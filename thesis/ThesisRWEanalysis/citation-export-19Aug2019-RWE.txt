AB: Excitement about the dramatic increase in potential successful anticancer medicines in recent years is hampered by the high costs involved as well as the length of time traditional pathways take for regulatory approval. The translation of experimental clinical data into real‐world evidence is also problematic. While the randomised controlled trial remains the gold standard for assessing efficacy and safety, there is increasing interest in the use of observational data to enable more rapid, informed and widespread availability and access to important anticancer medicines. Taking real‐world evidence into account in regulatory and health technology assessment in a thoughtful and balanced fashion will enrich and justify sound decision‐making.

AB: Regulators consider randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the gold standard for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medications, but their costs, duration, and limited generalizability have caused some to look for alternatives. Real world evidence based on data collected outside of RCTs, such as registries and longitudinal healthcare databases, can sometimes substitute for RCTs, but concerns about validity have limited their impact. Greater reliance on such real world data (RWD) in regulatory decision making requires understanding why some studies fail while others succeed in producing results similar to RCTs. Key questions when considering whether RWD analyses can substitute for RCTs for regulatory decision making are WHEN one can study drug effects without randomization and HOW to implement a valid RWD analysis if one has decided to pursue that option. The WHEN is primarily driven by externalities not controlled by investigators, whereas the HOW is focused on avoiding known mistakes in RWD analyses.

AB: Evidence from medication use in the real world setting can help to extrapolate and/ or augment data obtained in randomized controlled trials and establishes a broad picture of a medication’s place in everyday clinical practice. By supplementing and complementing safety and efficacy data obtained in a narrowly defined (and often optimized) patient population in the clinical trial setting, real world evidence (RWE) may provide stakeholders with valuable information about the safety and effectiveness of a medication in large, heterogeneous populations. RWE is emerging as a credible information source; however, there is scope for enhancements to real world data (RWD) sources by understanding their complexities and applying the most appropriate analytical tools in order to extract relevant information. In addition to providing information for clinicians, RWE has the potential to meet the burden of evidence for regulatory considerations and may be used in approval of new indications for medications. Further understanding of RWD collection and analysis is needed if RWE is to achieve its full potential.

AB: Data generated from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is recognized to have some limitations in its application to real‐life clinical experience due to patient selection criteria and the controlled environment. Utilizing real world evidence (RWE) of how medicines are used and perform in clinical practice offers an opportunity to bridge evidence gaps and validate RCT outcomes. Payers often want real world data to be local to their patient population to ensure its relevance. However, this presents a 'catch‐22:' at the point of reimbursement decision‐making the medicine is not on the market but you can only collect local RWE once a therapy is on the market. Nevertheless, Early Access Programs (EAPs), national programs that allow patients with severe diseases and no therapeutic alternatives to access therapies prior to their marketing authorisation, offer the potential to utilize local RWE to inform reimbursement decision‐making. This is especially in some countries which have well‐established cohort based programs under which many patients can be treated (ATU [France], law 648 [Italy], EAMS [UK], and FDA expanded access scheme [USA]). However, access to EAPs is typically only for patients with no treatment alternatives, who may be expected to have a poor performance status with worse treatment outcomes. EAPs may only operate for a limited duration of time pre‐authorization, limiting the data that can be collected. Further, EAPS are often designed to only be an option for those who cannot access RCTs and not interfere with the clinical trial development program, with restrictions on what data can be collected accordingly. Nevertheless, in certain settings EAPs may provide an opportunity to generate local real world evidence to help support product value at the point of initial reimbursement submissions. These include providing data on sub‐populations not represented in the RCTs and informing the design and predicting outcome of pay‐for‐performance reimbursement schemes.

AB: Confidence in the use of evidence of treatment effectiveness or comparative effectiveness from clinical studies for decision makers is bolstered by the adoption of good procedural practices. Such practices have been required by regulatory authorities and journal editors for pre‐approval randomized controlled trials and include study registration of trials on a public Web site before their conduct, the completion of an a priori protocol and data analysis plan, accountability for documenting any changes in study procedures, and the expectation that all randomized controlled trial results will be made public. Such good procedural practices have been neither widely promulgated nor followed for observational real‐world data studies. The task force provides a rationale for adopting similar good procedural practices for hypothesis evaluating treatment effectiveness studies. Adoption of such good practices will enhance the confidence of decision makers for including observational real‐world data studies into the corpus of evidence they consider for treatment effectiveness or comparative effectiveness.

AB: Introduction: ICD implantation carries a significant risk of complications, however published estimates appear inconsistent. We present a contemporary meta‐analysis (MA) of ICD complications in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and contrast it to recent data from the US National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) ICD registry. Methods: PubMed was searched for any RCTs involving ICD implantation published 1999‐2011; 18were identified for analysis including 6433 patients, mean follow‐up 3 mths‐5.6 yrs. Exclusion criteria ‐ studies of children, HCM, congenital HD, resynchronisation therapy & box changes. Results: Total complication rate (exc. inappropriate shocks) was 7.8%. Mean age 64 yrs, ejection fraction (EF) 30.5%, 80% male. Complications: access‐related 2.8 %; lead‐related 6.3% and generator‐related 3.0%. Infection rate was 2.3%.There were no predictors of complications but longer follow‐up showed a trend to higher complication rates (p=0.07). We also reviewed complication data from the most recent NCDR ICD publication of 356515 implants (2006‐2010). Mean age was 67.3 yrs, EF 27.9%, 72.7% male. Total major complication rate was 3.08%; lead displacement 1.02%, haematoma 0.86% & pneumothorax 0.44%. A comparison of the registry and MA data is shown in figure 1. Conclusion: The overall ICD complication rate in our meta‐analysis is 7.8% over 16 months. The ICD complication reported in the NCDR ICD registry is significantly lower despite a similar population. This may reflect under‐reporting of complications in registries. Reporting of ICD complications in RCTs and registries is very variable and there is a need to standardise classification of complications internationally. (Figure presented).

AB: INTRODUCTION: The Innovative Medicines Initiative, IMI‐GetReal project aimed to explore incorporation of robust methods for real‐world data (RWD) collection and synthesis earlier in the medicines development process, both by pharmaceutical companies and healthcare decision makers. The focus was on the potential use of RWD, alone or in combination with randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to demonstrate effectiveness of new interventions. Four case studies were conducted in multiple disease areas to examine methods for predicting drug effectiveness and the perspectives of different stakeholders on these methods. This study aimed to identify practical obstacles in accessing and using RWD and RCT data for effectiveness research conducted as part of these case studies. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis was conducted to identify and characterize key issues relating to accessing and analysing study data from external sources, both RWD and RCTs. RESULTS: Accessing RWD from registries proved difficult due to multiple reasons, including: complex and non‐transparent application procedures, resistance from registry owners to discuss applications and datasets not being research‐ready within project timeframes. There were also issues with the RWD eventually accessed, including a lack of individual participant data (IPD) and incomplete data. Where access to IPD from RCTs was obtainable, there were restrictions imposed on how it could be used. For example, it could not be used to target analysis on an individual product, but rather explore methodologies for data synthesis in a product‐anonymised setting. This condition encouraged additional data sharing by other stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the collaborative, multi‐stakeholder nature of IMI‐GetReal and proper disclosures with data owners, access to data proved challenging. Such barriers to data accessibility can delay effectiveness research, restrict opportunities for the development of methods incorporating RWD and diminish the potential use of RWD in decision making. Where data is intended to be used for this purpose, sufficient attention should be paid to these potential barriers.

AB: Purpose of the study: In this multicentre observational registry, we evaluated the real‐world clinical experience of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation using THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCHw Catheter. Method used: Patients with persistent AF (excluding long‐standing persistent AF) ablation were enrolled and followed for 12‐month (M) with a 3‐M blanking period. We assessed the early‐onset (>=7 days of index procedure) primary AEs, 12‐M success (patient‐reported freedom from symptomatic AF recurrence) and correlation of success with contact force (CF). Summary of results: A total of 152 patients (age, 61.5 + 9.4 years; 76.3% males; 90.8% Caucasian; LVEF, 56.9 + 10.1%; left atrial diameter, 41.8 + 7.9 mm) underwent catheter insertion and comprised the safety cohort. Effectiveness was assessed from the evaluable cohort; 144 patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria and received RF ablation. Primary AE rate was 3.9% (6/152) and the 12‐M success was 63.3% (95% CI: 54.4‐70.9%). Among patients with available CF data (n = 93), 72% and 19.4% of the procedures were set at a CF range of 5‐40 g and 10‐40 g, respectively. Mean (SD) CF for safety and evaluable cohorts was 16.2 (4.0) g and 16.1 (4.0) g, respectively. Investigators stayed within pre‐selected CF range 79.7 + 12.7% of the time. A trend of correlation of higher CF with 12‐M effectiveness (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.99‐1.27, P = 0.080) was observed. Furthermore, long‐term success is likely to increase when investigators stay within CF range >=80% vs ,80% of the time (69.2% vs 58.5%; P = 0.285). Conclusion: In this preliminary report of persistent AF ablation using the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCHw catheter from real‐world registry, 12M success was 63.3% and trended nonsignificantly towards improved success when operators stayed within their pre‐selected CF range >=80% of time.

DOI: 10.1177/1740774519833679
AB: Background: Pragmatic clinical trials often use automated data sources such as electronic health records, claims, or registries to identify eligible individuals and collect outcome information. A specific advantage that this automated data collection often yields is having data on potential participants when design decisions are being made. We outline how this data can be used to inform trial design. Methods: Our work is motivated by a pragmatic clinical trial evaluating the impact of suicide‐prevention outreach interventions on fatal and non‐fatal suicide attempts in the 18 months after randomization. We illustrate our recommended approaches for designing pragmatic clinical trials using historical data from the health systems participating in this study. Specifically, we illustrate how electronic health record data can be used to inform the selection of trial eligibility requirements, to estimate the distribution of participant characteristics over the course of the trial, and to conduct power and sample size calculations. Results: Data from 122,873 people with patient health questionnaire (PHQ) responses, recorded in their electronic health records between 1 July 2010 and 31 March 2012, were used to show that the suicide attempt rate in the 18 months following completion of the questionnaire varies by response to item nine of the PHQ. We estimated that the proportion of individuals with a prior recorded elevated PHQ (i.e. history of suicidal ideation) would decrease from approximately 50% at the beginning of a trial to about 5%, 50 weeks later. Using electronic health record data, we conducted simulations to estimate the power to detect a 25% reduction in suicide attempts. Simulation‐based power calculations estimated that randomizing 8000 participants per randomization arm would allow 90% power to detect a 25% reduction in the suicide attempt rate in the intervention arm compared to usual care at an alpha rate of 0.05. Conclusions: Historical data can be used to inform the design of pragmatic clinical trials, a strength of trials that use automated data collection for randomizing participants and assessing outcomes. In particular, realistic sample size calculations can be conducted using real‐world data from the health systems in which the trial will be conducted. Data‐informed trial design should yield more realistic estimates of statistical power and maximize efficiency of trial recruitment.

AB: With the wide availability of various real‐world data (RWD), there is an increasing interest in synthesizing information from both randomized clinical trials and RWD for health‐care decision makings. The task of addressing study‐specific heterogeneities is one of the most difficult challenges in synthesizing data from disparate sources. Bayesian hierarchical models with nonparametric extension provide a powerful and convenient platform that formalizes the information borrowing strength across the sources. In this paper, we propose a propensity score‐based Bayesian nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture model that summarizes subject‐level information from randomized and registry studies to draw inference on the causal treatment effect. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the model performance under different scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the proposed method using data from a clinical study on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for treating congestive heart failure.

AB: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have historically been considered the primary source of evidence to support market access and reimbursement. However, real‐world data (RWD) are increasingly being considered by industry and payers. The objectives of this research were to review the current perception of RWD across Europe and to assess how RWD can support market access and reimbursement. A review of the literature, guidelines from European health technology assessment (HTA) agencies and governmental authorities, case studies and the latest publications in value‐based assessment (VBA) was performed to summarise the current perception of RWD, and to identify the advantages and challenges of using RWD to support market access and reimbursement. Only 10 guidelines were found from 73 European HTA agencies or governmental authorities which cited RWD as a source for evidence. NICE acknowledges the difficulties of generalising RCT results to clinical practice, and supports the capture and analysis of observational data. In addition, recent developments in VBA anticipate a greater scrutiny of attempts to model natural history in economic evaluations, which may be addressed by using longitudinal observational data. Case studies have shown economic evaluations based on RCT data may lack external validity, and may consequently produce inaccurate estimates of economic endpoints. There is a consensus that RWD are valuable in providing clinical practice evidence on treatment pathways, resource use, long‐term natural history and true effectiveness. However, there are methodological challenges (such as lack of randomisation) to be addressed before RWD are widely accepted as a complement to RCTs to support decision‐making. RWD are increasingly recognised as a valuable source of evidence for market access and reimbursement, and as a complement to clinical trial evidence. Nevertheless, there are challenges that need to be addressed to ensure real world data provide valid evidence to the decision process.

AB: Background: The introduction of biosimilars has been linked with concerns regarding how to best monitor their similarity vs. the originator product using real world data. Methods: Data from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality register (SRQ) was used to identify all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatric arthritis (PsA), and other spondyloarthropathy (SpA), who started a treatment with infliximab (originator Remicade or biosimilars Remsima or Inflectra) between 1st Mar 2015 and 30th Sept 2016 or with etanercept (originator Enbrel or biosimilar Benepali) between 1st April 2016 and 30th Sept 2016. Results: During the study period, a total of 1833 patients started an infliximab treatment and 1793 started etanercept. These patients were either bDMARDnaive (patients without a history of any biological treatment), non‐medical switchers (patients who switched from the originator product), or patients who had a history of a previous (but not the same) bDMARD (Table 1). These three groups were not evenly distributed across originators or biosimilars, and had different baseline demographic and disease characteristics. The uptake in terms of treatment starts was faster for Benepali (it covered more than 90% of this part of the etanercept market after only 3 months) as compared to Remsima and Inflectra (together they accounted for 88% of this section of the infliximab market after 10 months). The uptake of biosimilars in terms of proportion of all patient on treatment was, at the end of September 2016, 27% of all infliximab (after 18 months of marketing) and 16% of etanercept (after 5 months since marketing). In contrast to the bio‐naive group and those with a history of a previous (but not the same biologic), there was no readily available comparator group for the non‐medical switcher group. To this end, we assessed three tentative definitions for a comparator; i) a historical comparison, i.e., same patients 18 months before the switch, ii) an individually matched sample of those patients still on originator treatment at the time of the switch, and iii) the total cohort of those who had not switched. Conclusions: "Uptake" of biosimilars can be expressed both as proportion of all new starts and as proportion of ongoing treatments. Assessments of uptake, and any comparison between biosimilars and their originators, need to be based on line of therapy in order to avoid mixing up effects of channeling with true differences between originator and similar. For the same reason, any originator comparator for non‐medical switchers needs to be reflective of those patients who stood the same chances of switching, but did not switch.

Medical records of patients treated with new drugs with an assessment report and approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee in 2013 were analysed. Data collected were costs, main effectiveness and safety variables, and indications. These were compared to the values of the same variables in the drug assessment reports conducted for inclusion in the hospital formulary. Percentage deviation was calculated for each drug comparing percentages, means or medians in hospital patients to those in the assessment report. Then, the median (range) of all drugs was calculated. Other collected data were therapeutic group, quality of evidence, and criteria for use. Results: We analysed 8 drugs, 50% oncologic‐hematologic, used in 125 patients. Phase 3 trials were available in 80% of the cases. Forty percent of the drugs were approved in the hospital with specific criteria for use. Compliance with these criteria was observed in a median of 91% of the patients (ranging in different drugs from 0 to 100%). Half of the drugs were used off‐label in at least one patient. Effectiveness was different from expected, a median of 22% lower in real world practice (range ‐100% to +35%). In practice, safety was worse than expected in one case. Median cost was higher than expected in 25% of the drugs. Conclusions: In this pilot study, a deviation from drug assessment reports was observed in real world regarding effectiveness, safety, uses and costs. These results need to be confirmed in a larger study. Factors related to the deviation have to be further analysed. Real world data are necessary to improve decision making.

AB: Background and aims: Sodium glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2‐i) ameliorate hyperglycemia by blocking renal glucose reabsorption and are indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to evaluate short‐term renal outcomes in a real‐world cohort of new users of SGLT2‐i compared to new users of Dipeptidyl Peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP‐4i). Materials and methods: Included in this retrospective cohort study were patients with T2DM who initiated SGLT2‐i or DPP‐4i during 1/4/2015‐ 30/6/2017, had a baseline serum creatinine (SCr) measurement within 180 days prior to treatment initiation and had a second SCr measurement, hospitalization with acute kidney injury (AKI) or death within 24 weeks of index date. Primary endpoints were (1) ≥30% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline; and (2) hospitalization with AKI, initiation of dialysis, or sustained eGFR of <15 mL/min/ 1.73 m2. Additional endpoints included deterioration in chronic kidney disease (CKD) category, doubling of SCr, hospitalization for AKI, allcause mortality and hospitalization for any cause. Results: Overall, 6418 and 5604 patients initiated SGLT2‐i and DPP‐4i, respectively. Baseline mean (SD) eGFR was higher among SGLT2‐i users (88.3 [17.4] mL/min/1.73 m2) vs. DPP‐4i users (82.8 [23.7] mL/ min/1.73 m2), yet eGFR levels were similar between groups when stratified by CKD stages. Fewer patients with eGFR ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were in the SGLT2‐i (n = 503, 7.8%) vs. DPP4‐i group (n = 1059, 18.9%). The adjustedOR(95%CI) for ≥30%reduction in eGFR with SGLT2‐i vs. DPP4‐i was 0.70 (0.49‐1.00) and adjusted ORs ranged from 1.97 (0.62‐ 6.26) to 0.45 (0.21‐0.99) in patients with baseline eGFR 30‐45 and ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The adjusted OR for CKD stage deterioration was 1.01 (0.90‐1.14). Although not statistically significant, a similar trend was observed with adjusted ORs ranging from 1.95 (0.96‐ 3.97) to 0.85 (0.68‐1.08) among patients with baseline eGFR 30‐45 and 60‐90 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. There was a lower risk of hospitalization for AKI with SGLT2‐i vs. DPP‐4i (adjusted OR (95% CI) 0.47 (0.27‐0.80)) with grossly similar ORs across eGFR categories. Two patients initiated dialysis, both in the DPP‐4i group. All‐causemortality, and hospitalizations were reduced with SGLT2‐i vs. DPP‐4i as well (adjusted OR (95% CI) 0.43 (0.20‐0.95) and 0.66 (0.56‐0.78) respectively). Conclusion: This real‐world data analysis supports evidence from previous randomized clinical trials demonstrating a reduction in hospitalizations for AKI, any hospitalizations and mortality among SGLT2‐i users across all CKD categories. Nevertheless, due to the more prominent decrease in eGFR in patients with moderate CKD, cautious use of these agents in patients with low eGFR is advisable.

AB: Background: In recent years, novel anticoagulant drugs have been introduced in the clinical armamentarium and have progressively gained momentum. Although their use is increasing among CKD patients, some skepticism about their risk‐benefit ratio still persists. We sought to investigate the safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban in a cohort of moderate‐to‐advanced CKD patients. Methods: This observational, retrospective, longitudinal study involved 347 consecutive CKD stage 3b‐4 (according to NKF‐KDOQI guidelines) patients enrolled from 8 cardiac outpatient clinics between March 2015 and October 2017. All patients received anticoagulation (100 warfarin vs. 247 rivaroxaban) as part of their non‐valvular atrial fibrillation management at the attending physician's discretion. Clinical effectiveness (defined as the occurrence of ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, or transient ischemic attack) and safety (intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal or other bleeding) were assessed separately. Results: Over a mean follow‐up period of 16 +/‐ 0.3 months, 25 stroke episodes (15 hemorrhagic, and 10 ischemic) occurred in 24 warfarin treated patients vs. none in the rivaroxaban arm. There were 5 vs. 0 episodes of deep venous thrombosis and 8 vs. 2 major episodes of bleeding in the warfarin and rivaroxaban groups, respectively. In contrast, the proportion of minor episodes of bleeding was similar between groups. Conclusion: Rivaroxaban seems a safe and effective therapeutic option in CKD stage 3b‐4 patients. However, future randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively establish the role of rivaroxaban in CKD patients. Copyright © 2018 Italian Society of Nephrology

AB: Aim: To assess the possible risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the use of sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2‐i) as well as changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hospitalizations and mortality in a real‐world setting. Materials and methods: Included in this historical cohort study were patients with type 2 diabetes in a large health organization in Israel who initiated therapy with SGLT2‐i or dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP‐4i) during 1 April 2015 to 30 June 2017. We collected data on serum creatinine measurements taken between 180 days prior to and 24 weeks after therapy initiation. Study endpoints included ≥30% reduction in eGFR, hospitalization with AKI, any hospitalization and all‐cause mortality. Results: Overall 6418 and 5604 patients initiated SGLT2‐i and DPP‐4i, respectively. Baseline mean (SD) eGFR was higher among the SGLT2‐i group compared with the DPP‐4i group (88.3 [17.4] and 82.8 [23.7], respectively) but were similar when stratifying by chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for ≥30% reduction in eGFR with SGLT2‐i versus DPP4‐i was 0.70 (0.49‐1.00) and ORs ranged from 1.97 (0.62‐6.26) to 0.45 (0.21‐0.99) in patients with baseline eGFR 30 to 45 and ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Risks of AKI (OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.27‐0.80), hospitalization (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.56‐0.78) or all‐cause mortality (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.20‐0.95) were lower in patients initiating SGLT2‐i versus DPP‐4i. Conclusions: This real‐world data analysis supports reassuring findings from previous randomized clinical trials showing no increased AKI risk among SGLT2‐i users. Nevertheless, because of the more prominent decrease in eGFR in patients with moderate CKD, cautious use of SGLT2‐i in patients with reduced eGFR is advised.

AB: Randomized controlled trials provide evidence for regulatory agencies, shape clinical practice, influence formulary decisions and have important implications for patients. However, many patient groups that are major consumers of drugs are underrepresented. We review 3 methods that use information from real world data (RWD) to extrapolate evidence from trial participants to different target populations following market approval and discuss how they could be implemented to support regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) decisions. The strategies include 1) re‐weighting (standardization) methods, 2) cross‐design synthesis, and 3) discrete event simulation. As a motivating example, we work through a fictional case‐study of a phase III trial investigating the efficacy of a new drug, fantastistatin, compared to the standard of care, normastatin, on risk of major adverse cardiac events. The three methods share the ability to provide estimated measures of occurrence (e.g. rates) and measures of effect (e.g. risk differences and risk ratios) in populations different from enrolled trial participants. The methods have some shared limitations. They require that relevant outcomes and risk factors are measurable, measured, and that algorithms used to define conditions capture approximately the same clinical concepts in trial and observational data. Additionally, when the target population has characteristics that are underrepresented in the trial, a few trial participants can have a great deal of influence on weights or extrapolation algorithms. The methods have unique strengths and limitations that may make one more appropriate than another in different contexts. While these methods are not a substitute for less restrictive pre‐approval RCTs or rigorous observational studies after accumulation of sufficient data post‐approval, they can help fill the evidence gap in the early marketing period. Early evidence using methods to generalize trial evidence should be reported with clear explanation of assumptions and limitations when used to support regulatory and health technology assessment decisions.

AB: Background: Checkpoint inhibitors have proven effectiveness in clinical trials for non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but if this is congruent with routine patient care is discussed. We present real‐world experience with the PD1‐inhibitor nivolumab in NSCLC. Patients and methods: Patients with NSCLC were considered eligible for nivolumab treatment after one or more lines of chemotherapy, and when in reasonable performance status (PS) [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) < 3]. Treatment was given according to guidelines in the two phase III studies, CA209017 and CA209057. Response evaluation was done according to Recist 1.1, and treatment given until unequivocal progression or intolerable toxicity. Results: Fifty‐eight patients (30 females) commenced therapy in the period June‐August 2015. Median age was 64.6 years (range 32.3‐88.2). Twenty‐four patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 32 adenocarcinoma, 38 had received two or more prior lines of therapy. Fourteen cases (24%) were in ECOG PS 2. After a medium observation time of 14.3 months, 13 (22%) are still in treatment. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 4.0 months, 34% were off treatment during the first two months. Median overall survival (OS) is 11.7 months. There was no difference in TTF or OS among patients with squamous versus non‐squamous histology or between 1 versus >1 prior line of therapy. Four patients (7%) were off treatment due to toxicity, none were grade 4 or 5. Conclusion: Nivolumab treatment outside clinical trials seems to perform as expected.

AB: Background: Endovascular thrombectomy trials established efficacy in acute ischemic stroke, yet realworld data on device effectiveness is warranted. Core lab adjudication of angiography is required to validate reperfusion, providing evidence and detailed data beyond randomized, controlled trials. We report the largest endovascular therapy registry data linking independent core lab data on reperfusion with clinical outcomes. Methods: The Trevo Retriever Registry is a prospective, open‐label, consecutive enrollment, multicenter, international registry with more than 65 enrolling sites worldwide. An independent Imaging Core Lab, blind to all other data, evaluates the angiography with a battery of various TICI scores (mTICI, oTICI, oTICI2C) to define reperfusion. Statistical analyses examined TICI reperfusion and association with clinical outcomes considering expansive data collected in the registry. Results: 506 enrolled subjects (mean age 68.2 +/‐ 14.2 yrs; 53% female) had core lab adjudicated angiography as of July 2016, including 21.5% > 80 years old. Baseline NIHSS was median 15.0 (9.0, 20.0) with time from onset to CT of median 4.0 (1.7, 9.7) hrs. Core lab adjudicated arterial occlusion sites were: 53% M1, 24% ICA, 16% M2, 4% Basilar and 2% other. Time to reperfusion (oTICI >= 2A) was median 30.0 (19.0, 42.0) min. Core lab adjudicated revascularization was mTICI >= 2B in 90.4% (95%CI 87.4, 92.9), oTICI >= 2B in 82.3% (95%CI 78.6, 85.6) and oTICI2C >= 2C in 45.0% (95%CI 40.5, 49.6). mRS of 0‐2 at 90 days was achieved in 57.3% (95%CI 52.5, 62.1). Extensive clinical, laboratory and stroke workflow variables were considered, yet only male sex (OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.38, 0.99) was an independent predictor of successful reperfusion (oTICI >= 2B) while age (OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.97), NIHSS (OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.88, 0.94) and diabetes (OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.33, 0.88) predicted mRS 0‐2 at 90 days. Conclusions: Proven reperfusion rates after endovascular stroke therapy excel in the real‐world translation of thrombectomy devices around the globe, leading to good outcomes after stroke.

AB: Health technology assessment (HTA) evaluates the efficacy and effectiveness of new interventions, integrates these data with the costs to define efficiency and addresses future availability and distribution. As such, HTA focuses on accessibility, affordability and equity. Economic evaluations are central in this concept: weighing costs and effects, they support evidence‐based decisions on reimbursement, thus endorsing the introduction of innovative healthcare interventions in daily practice. After more than 20 years of voluntary cooperation on HTA in Europe, more than 50 HTA bodies are currently operating in the European Union (EU), be it still fragmented with different systems, different procedures and different requirements regarding the type of clinical evidence. Efficacy, the outcome a new intervention provides in the well‐defined circumstances of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and typically the input used to derive cost‐effectiveness evidence, may not provide the best insight into the impact of an intervention in daily clinical care. Moreover, in contrast to what is the case for pharmaceuticals, it is much more difficult to perform RCTs on radiotherapy or surgery, especially when it comes to evaluating the incremental evolution typical for new techniques and technologies, or the long‐term benefits anticipated to follow more accurate treatment delivery. This has resulted in different regulatory systems for systemic and non‐systemic treatment strategies, with attempts to come to a more homogenised HTA approach in the EU having so far failed. Real‐world data are gradually expanding their role in the evidence generation of lung cancer radiotherapy. A first step moving away from RCTs is to adopt a more pragmatic approach to evidence generation, as is the case in the OligoCare project. This joint ESTRO‐EORTC initiative is evaluating the outcome of oligometastatic patients, amongst others from primary lung cancer, treated with radical radiotherapy in a large prospective cohort study. Various patterns of care studies have generated clinical evidence on the uptake of new treatment techniques such as SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy), on the value of multimodality treatments for locally‐advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) beyond the context of RCTs, or have allowed to develop prediction models to support shared decision‐making. Furthermore, the wealth of data available in cancer registries and other nation‐wide databases can be leveraged to learn more about the quality of care, actual access to different treatment strategies, geographical and institutional variations and their potential impact on lung cancer survival. Real‐life data can also be used to generate the cost information necessary to perform cost‐effectiveness evaluations. Besides the more frequent approach to derive this evidence from reimbursement data, actual resource costs can also be computed in daily practice. One such initiative was undertaken in Belgium, using Time‐Driven Activity‐Based Costing to compute real‐life costs of radiotherapy, and more specifically of innovative radiotherapy techniques such as SBRT. Whereas all these examples provide interesting insight into the clinical and financial consequences of access to standard‐of‐care and innovative lung cancer radiotherapy, there is a dearth of information on how this evidence defines policy. One interesting approach to change practice is using coverage with evidence generation to provide early access to radiotherapy innovations, while stimulating the further generation of data. Such a programme of provisional financing has been set‐up in Belgium to generate evidence from daily practice on SBRT for primary tumours, most typically early‐stage NSCLC, and for oligometastatic disease. While this programme allowed radiation oncology centres to develop and provide SBRT without being financially penalised, it also generated the reassuring clinical evidence that will soon lead to the inclusion of SBRT in the formal national radiotherapy reimbursement system.

AB: Objective: Chronic symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (SND), the most common bradyarrhythmia, can be effectively managed by permanent cardiac pacing. Yet the care pathway and barriers to adoption of pacing therapy are not well understood ‐ particularly in low volume implanting countries. The IMPROVE Brady study is a quality improvement initiative being conducted at centers in South Asia, Latin America, and Russia. We assessed the rates of SND diagnosis and pacemaker treatment for SND in the South Asia cohort. Methods: The prospective study enrolled patients with heart rate of <50 beats per minute presenting with symptoms including syncope, dizziness, and/or dyspnea from ten centers in India and Bangladesh. Patients were followed to identify the proportion diagnosed with SND and subsequently treated with pacemaker therapy. Results: A total of 508 patients meeting criteria were enrolled and followed on average for 8.3. +/‐. 8.0. months. Patients were on average 58 years of age, 77% were male, and 91% had completed at least primary education. An SND diagnosis was made in 368 (72%) of patients, with the majority (80%) of diagnoses occurring within 1 month of enrollment. Of the patients with an SND diagnosis, 63 (17%) were treated with a pacemaker. Reasons for not receiving treatment were: subject refusal or deferred decision (45%), unaffordability (34%), physician determined ‐ not‐indicated (20%), and other (1%). Older age, female gender, history of hypertension, lower resting heart rate, and syncopal or pre‐syncopal symptoms were associated with a higher probability of implant. Conclusions: In a care pathway assessment for the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic SND in South Asia only 1 in 6 patients received pacemaker indicated therapy, largely due to patient refusal and physician decision. Phase II of the study will be aimed to improve this treatment rate. Copyright © 2017.

AB: Introduction: Carfilzomib is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of proteasome which exerts clinically significant anti‐myeloma effect. Randomized phase 2 and 3 studies have validated carfilzomib as an effective therapy in relapsed or refractory myeloma setting. In our country, Carfilzomib has recently gained approval in relapsed refractory setting in patients who were both refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug (imid). Before this approval we were able to use carfilzomib as a single agent or as part of a combination approach via approval of health authority. Here we present our retrospective, multicenter, real life experience among patients with relapsed refractory myeloma and treated with carfilzomib. Methods: 152 heavily pre‐treated patients from 15 centers were retrospectively evaluated and the data among the use of carfilzomib, its efficacy and safety were analyzed. Results: Median age of the patients included in the study was 69 (43‐86) with a male ratio of 56.6%. ISS groups at diagnosis were as follows, stage 1 22.4%, stage 2 51.3% and stage 3 26.3%. 14 of 80 patients (17.5%) were classified as high risk myeloma with an either del 17p or t(4,14) FISH positivity. Most of the patients were refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor (90.8%), at least one one imid (84.2%), or both 75.6%. Only a small number of patients have used carfilzomib with one other immunomodulatory drug (26.3%) and remaining majority used it as a single agent. All patients have received concomitant corticosteroids and were able to receive at least 2 cycles of carfilzomib. Median number of prior therapy line was 4 (3‐8). Overall response rate was 40.8% (complete response + very good partial remission rate 13.2% and Partial remission rate 27.6%). Median duration of response was 4.8 months. Median progression free survival was 6 months and median overall survival was 10.4 months after initiation of carfilzomib. Hematological toxicity was the major toxicity which were reported at 61.8 % of patients. Other major toxicities were as follows: combined cardiovascular toxicity (heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypertension) 26.3 %, renal toxicity 9.2 %. Conclusions: Carfilzomib based treatment is efficient in advanced multiple myeloma. Even in a heavily pre‐treated real‐life patient group, carfilzomib led to a significant response rate. Most important side effects were hematological and cardiovascular.

AB: Background: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a painful, chronic inflammatory skin disease with few options for effective treatment. Phase 3 multicenter trials of adalimumab for this invalidant disease have been published with promising results. However, to the best of our knowledge, no data about real‐life data effectiveness of this recently approved therapy is available. Material and Methods: A retrospective multicenter study (ADAHS study) including both Hurley II and Hurley III patients that initiated adalimumab therapy from 9 Spanish specialized units was performed. A posterior subanalysis comparing our results with data of clinical response rates at week 12 previously published in the literature from PIONEER I and II assays (PIONEER group) was also done. The primary end point was a clinical response, defined as at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the abscess and inflammatory‐nodule count, with no increase in abscess or draining‐fistula counts, at week 12. Results: Fifty‐seven men and 34 women, aged between 18 and 62 years were collected. We excluded 5 patients that not accomplish the required follow‐up time. Clinical response rates at week 12 were significantly higher for the ADAHS study patients than for the PIONEER group. Respecting Hurley II patients, 81.82% of ADAHS study cases reached the HiSCR versus 44.6% in PIONEER I and 62.4% in PIONEER II. In Hurley III Patients, 73.81% of ADAHS study cases reached the HiSCR versus 38.6% in PIONEER I and 55.1% in PIONEER II. Patients from ADAHS study had significantly greater improvement than PIONEER groups in rank‐ordered secondary outcomes (pain, odor, pruritus, and functional impairment). Serious adverse events in the 12‐week follow‐up (excluding worsening of underlying disease) were not registered in the ADAHS study, versus 1.3% and <4.6% of patients receiving adalimumab in PIONEER I and II respectively. Limitations: The small sample size is considered. Conclusions: The analysis of adalimumab effectiveness and safety at week 12 in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa based on real world life data, resulted in significantly higher clinical response rates and a better adverse events rate compared with previous published trials. (This study has been approved by the local ethical committee and by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices, and no conflicts of interest are reported).

AB: Introduction: Novel P2Y12, Ticagrelor and Prasugrel, had been demonstrated to be superior to Clopidogrel in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Better clinical outcomes are obtained due to their potency and rapid onset of action. Recently it has been questioned the benefits of Ticagrelor and its clinical impact in the short‐term mortality. Objectives: To describe the "real world" data of the efficacy and security of Ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel in patients with an acute myocardial infarction admitted in a cardiac intensive care unit. Methods: This is a retrospective multicentre observational study from the ARIAM‐Andalusia registry of patients admitted with an AMI. Mayor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, composite of death, non fatal myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization and stroke) and bleeding events were collected prospectively between 2013 and 2015, during hospitalization and after 30 days of the event/discharge. Net clinical benefit of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel was analysed using a Cox regression model adjusted by using propensity score greedy matching (PS 1:1) and inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) Results: 1889 patients were included (58% STEMI, 46% GRACE Score > 140, 93% PCI), 1313 were treated with clopidogrel and 576 with ticagrelor. Patients treated with ticagrelor were younger, more likely to be admitted for STEMI, had better reperfusion times and higher PCI rate. 30 day non‐adjusted analysis showed a lower mortality (HR=0.21 IC95% [0.11‐0.43]; p<0,0001) in the ticagrelor group, without an increase in the bleeding rate (HR=0.95 IC95% [0.54‐1.62];p=0.940), so a net clinical benefit of ticagrelor was demonstrated (HR=0.48 IC95% [0.33‐0.72];p<0,0001). The adjusted analysis confirmed the net clinical benefit of ticagrelor PS (574 matched patients, standardized differences<10%) HR=0,63 IC95% [0.39‐0.90]; p<0,0001, IPTW (n=1889) HR=0.46 IC95% [0.27‐0.79]; p=0,049. Moreover, an early reduction of mortality was observed in the ticagrelor group (PS HR=0.28 IC95% [0.11‐0.61]; p<0.0001, IPTW HR=0.26 IC95% [0.13‐0.54]; p<0.0001). In the subgroup analysis, ticagrelor also showed net clinical benefit in those patients with higher bleeding risk (>75 years, previous stroke, chronic kidney disease and high CRUSADE score). Conclusions: Real world data showed that ticagrelor was associated with a higher net clinical benefit compared to clopidogrel, even though in patients with higher bleeding risk, with an early reduction in mortality.

AB: Analyses using administrative claims databases or national registries provide estimates of benefits and harms of medications in real‐world settings for large and diverse patient populations. Whereas claims‐based nonrandomized studies and randomized‐controlled trials (RCTs) have distinct limitations, their strengths are complementary. Integrating RCT and claims data offers substantial synergies. We propose obtaining routinely collected longitudinal claims data from RCT participants and discuss the added value of the novel evidence that can be derived from this "information overlap."

AB: Background: Ramucirumab‐alone or combined with paclitaxel‐represents one of the main options for patients failing first‐line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Objective: The RAMoss study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of ramucirumab in the "real‐life setting". Patients and Methods: Patients from 25 Italian hospitals started therapy consisting of ramucirumab 8 mg/kg i.v. d1,15q28 with or without paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 i.v. d1,8,15q28. The primary endpoint was safety, and secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression‐free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: One hundred sixty‐seven patients with disease progression on first‐line therapy received ramucirumab as monotherapy (10%) or combined with paclitaxel (90%). Median treatment duration was 4 months (1‐17 months). Global incidence of grade (G) 3‐4 toxicity was 9.6%, and for neutropenia 5.4%; treatment was discontinued due to toxicity in 3% of patients. The most frequent adverse events (AE) were G1‐2 fatigue (27.5%), G1‐2 neuropathy (26.3%), and G1‐2 neutropenia (14.9%). ORR was 20.2%. Stable disease was observed in 39.2% of patients, with a disease control rate of 59.4%. With a median follow‐up of 11 months, median PFS was 4.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1‐4.7), whereas median OS was 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.09‐8.9). In a multivariate analysis, ECOG performance status <1 or >=1 (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.0‐1.27, p = 0.04) and the presence versus absence of peritoneal metastases (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.63‐2.39, p = 0.03) were independent poor prognostic factors. Conclusions: These "real‐life" efficacy data on ramucirumab treatment are in line with previous randomized trials. Ramucirumab is well tolerated in daily clinical practice.

AB: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. Dabigatran etixalate (DE) is one of the new oral anticoagulant drugs being used in nonvalvular AF (NVAF). There is no adequate real world data in different populations about DE. The aim of this registry was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DE Consecutive NVAF patients treated with warfarin or both DE doses were enrolled during 18 months study period. The patients were re‐evaluated at regular 6‐month intervals during the follow‐up period. During the follow‐up period outcomes were documented according to RELY methodology A total of 555 patients were analyzed. There was no significant difference in ischemic stroke rates (p = 0.73), death rates (p = 0.15) and MI rates (p = 0.56) between groups. The rate of major bleeding was significantly higher in warfarin and dabigatran 150 mg group than dabigatran 110 mg (p < 0.001). Intracranial bleeding rate and relative risk were significantly lower in dabigatran 110 mg group than warfarin group (p = 0.004). Dyspepsia was significantly higher in both DE doses than warfarin (p = 0.004) Both DE doses are as effective as warfarin in reducing stroke rates in NVAF patients, without increasing MI rates. Intracranial bleeding rates are significantly lower in warfarin than both doses of DE and gastrointestinal bleeding risk increases with increased DE doses.

AB: Objectives To characterize and describe treatment with Ulipristal acetate (UPA) in a pre‐operative setting and to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) outcomes in a population treated according to standard clinical practice in the EU. Study design Multi‐centre, prospective, non‐interventional study (PREMYA) of patients diagnosed with moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids and undergoing a pre‐operative treatment with UPA (Esmya) at 73 clinical practice sites within the EU. Patients were followed during UPA treatment and for 12 months after treatment discontinuation for a total of 15 months follow‐up. Data was collected every 3 months in accordance with standard care visits. Results A total of 1568 women were enrolled, of whom 1473 were found to be eligible for data analysis. Only 38.8% of patients underwent surgery, of which the majority were of a conservative/minimally invasive nature. Physicians' assessments of patients' overall symptomatic change, as measured on the Clinical Global Impression‐Improvement (CGI‐I) scale, indicated that 60% of patients were much improved or very much improved at 3 months. Pain and quality of life after treatment cessation remain lower than baseline during the entire period of follow‐up Conclusions The majority of patients do not undergo surgery immediately after treatment cessation. Quality of life and pain are highly improved by Esmya treatment. Copyright © 2016

AB: Background: The role of real‐world data (RWD) in single technology appraisal (STA) submissions is to complement evidence collected from clinical trials and contextualise the anticipated real‐world use of a technology. The potential for RWD to strengthen reimbursement submissions has been increasingly recognised, although little research has been conducted to ascertain their use. Objectives: To determine the frequency and type of RWD incorporated in manufacturers' submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence STA process. A secondary objective was to identify the Evidence Review Group (ERG) and the Appraisal Committee's explicit requests for RWD. Methods: We reviewed STA guidance and manufacturers' submissions for technologies indicated for solid tumours (January 2010 to December 2015). We extracted information describing the type of RWD used to support clinical effectiveness, safety or the following types of economic model inputs: comparators and treatment patterns, disease progression, survival, and resource utilisation. We classified the type of RWD according to a pre‐defined hierarchy of evidence. Additionally, we extracted critiques and recommendations made by ERG and the Appraisal Committee regarding RWD and future research that could be informed by RWD. Results: Overall, 48 STAs in solid tumours were identified. Among those, five were terminated or withdrawn and three were multiple technology appraisals, thus leaving 40 STAs for extraction. Approximately 80% of STAs included RWD; in the remainder, RWD was either absent or unclear. In less than 10% of STAs, RWD informed clinical effectiveness and safety. More frequently, RWD was used to inform survival (e.g. extrapolation beyond the duration of the randomised controlled trial) or resource utilisation. In several STAs, the ERG or Appraisal Committee explicitly requested RWD or critiqued their validity. Conclusions: RWD inform central components of STA submissions. Our findings emphasize that these data should be collected using robust research designs, with high external validity; failure to do so may contribute to the Committee's uncertainty of the plausibility of the submitted evidence.

AB: Objectives: This research aims to have a trial calculation on the medical cost reduction for the patient group prescribed the combination drug of ARB and calcium antagonist (a Combination Drug Group) against the patient group prescribed the combination use of ARB and calcium antagonist (a Combined Application Group). Methods: We used the data of Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC), which provides health insurance claims data with linked health check‐up data of 1.7 million members from health insurance societies in Japan. Since the data is not based on randomized controlled trial, we adjusted confounding factors using propensity score analysis. Through the examination, we found that the propensity score can be modeled by logistic regression including following four variables: age, square of age, log of medical cost before index time and square of log of medical cost before index time. Results: As a result of our research, we estimated the adjusted average of medical cost for Combination Drug Group is lower by 900 yen per a month than that for Combined Application Group, which represents 1.7% of adjusted average monthly medical cost for Combined Application Group, 52,100 yen. Conclusions: Our research utilizing the real world data concluded that the combination drug of ARB and calcium antagonist can have a reductive, though limited, impact on the medical cost. Considering the general tendency that the medication cost itself of combination drug is higher than that of the combined use of drugs, we conclude that the result shows meaningful example of real world data analysis.

AB: Observational analyses for causal inference often rely on real world data collected for purposes other than research. A frequent goal of these observational analyses is to use the data to emulate a hypothetical randomized experiment, i.e., the target trial, that mimics the design features of a true experiment, including a clear definition of time zero with synchronization of treatment assignment and determination of eligibility. We review a recent observational analysis that explicitly emulated a target trial of screening colonoscopy using insurance claims from U.S. Medicare. We then compare this explicit emulation with alternative, simpler observational analyses that do not synchronize treatment assignment and eligibility determination at time zero and/or do not allow for repeated eligibility. This empirical comparison suggests that lack of an explicit emulation of the target trial leads to biased estimates, and shows that allowing for repeated eligibility increases the statistical efficiency of the estimates.

AB: Background: In recent years there has been an increasing, partially also critical interest in understanding the potential benefits of generating real‐world evidence (RWE) in medicine. Objectives: The benefits and limitations of RWE in the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are described along with a view on how they may complement each other as partners in the generation of evidence for clinical oncology. Moreover, challenges and success factors in building an effective RWE network of cooperating cancer centers are analyzed and discussed. Material and methods: This article is based on a selective literature search (predominantly 2015‐2017) combined with our practical experience to date in establishing European oncology RWE networks. Results: RWE studies can be highly valuable and complementary to RCTs due to their high external validity. If cancer centers successfully address the various challenges in the establishment of an effective RWE study network and in the consequent execution of studies, they may efficiently generate high‐quality research findings on treatment effectiveness and safety. Concerns pertaining to data privacy are of utmost importance and discussed accordingly. Securing data completeness, accuracy, and a common data structure on routinely collected disease and treatment‐related data of patients with cancer is a challenging task that requires high engagement of all participants in the process. Conclusion: Based on the discussed prerequisites, the analysis of comprehensive and complex real‐world data in the context of a RWE study network represents an important and promising complementary partner to RCTs. This enables research into the general quality of cancer care and can permit comparative effectiveness studies across partner centers. Moreover, it will provide insights into a broader optimization of cancer care, refined therapeutic strategies for patient subgroups as well as avenues for further research in oncology.

AB: Background Describe how RWD sources can be used to support theplanning and execution of randomized controlled trialsIdentify barriers and potential solutions to adoptionof RWE generationDescribe practical models and operational guidancefor the use of RWD in randomized clinical trials to generate RWE in specific clinical trial operations activitiesMethodsRWD sources and RWE generation hold great promisefor increasing the quality and efficiency of clinical trials.Panelists will discuss evidence findings to date fromCTTI's work on incorporating RWE into RCTs forregulatory decision making.Abstract Details: Real world data (RWD) can potentially support the evaluation of new medical products,new indications, and labeling changes at significantlylower cost and participant burden than with traditionalrandomized clinical trials (RCTs). Additionally, recentinclusion of real world evidence (RWE) provisions inthe 21st Century Cures Act and Prescription Drug UserFee Act VI Commitment Letter have focused attentionon using RWD sources.Despite growing interest in leveraging RWD andRWE for clinical research, there are relatively fewexamples to inform such efforts‐and a lack of consensus among stakeholders about appropriate methods forusing RWD and RWE to support clinical trials has slowed progress in this field.The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI)is addressing this gap by developing evidence‐based recommendations that foster greater awareness and appropriate use of RWD sources that can be integrated intoRCTs to produce RWE, specifically for the purposes ofregulatory decision making.Ultimately, the broad adoption of RWE for regulatory trials will benefit patients and other stakeholdersby creating high‐quality, reliable evidence to supportthe evaluation of medical products, new indications,and labeling changes at lower cost and participant burden than is possible with RCTs. The use of RWDalso offers opportunities to answer important questionsabout the benefits and potential risks of medical products that are difficult or impossible to answer followingtraditional methodologies.Attendees of this session will learn: How RWD sources can be used to support theplanning and execution of randomized controlledtrials. The barriers and potential solutions to the adoptionof RWE generation. The concerns with RWD and RWE, how they canbe addressed, and when using RWD/RWE isimpractical or unwise. The practical models and operational guidance forthe use of RWD in randomized clinical trials togenerate RWE in specific clinical trial operationsactivities.

AB: Objectives: Network meta‐analysis (NMA) is widely used to compare multiple interventions of interest when head‐to‐head comparisons of active treatments are not available. Most NMAs pool data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on a single clinical outcome. However, in the case of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), outcomes are often reported at different time points and long‐term real‐world data (RWD) is routinely collected as part of national registries. Evaluation of models for the inclusion of different time measures in NMA, especially from both a regulatory and reimbursement perspective, is thus warranted and is considered here. Methods: RCTs and observational studies evaluating biological agents in RA were searched using standard filters and electronic databases. Networks of RCTs were supplemented with RWD to include outcomes extracted for as many time points as possible. Multivariate NMA models were extended to incorporate repeated measures, adjusting for correlation between time points and bias of RWD. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to test different network sizes, correlation structures and bias adjustments. Results: Addition of RWD and studies reporting treatment effects at multiple time points significantly increased the evidence base for NMA in RA. The inclusion of RWD led to a reduction in the level of uncertainty around most of the effect estimates. Furthermore, the additional evidence from multiple times has potential of reducing uncertainty by 'borrowing' evidence and giving a fuller view of treatment effect over time, not just at a specific single time point. Conclusions: Initial evaluation of these models in NMA indicates that extending an evidence base to include repeated measures and RWD maximises study network sizes and can significantly impact the level of uncertainty in treatment effects. Further investigation of correlation and bias modelling is warranted, as too is the application of new NMA fractional polynomials model to RA.

AB: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of new targeted therapies in kidney cancer has shaped disease management in the metastatic phase. Our study aims to conduct a cost‐utility analysis of sunitinib versus pazopanib in first‐line setting in Canada for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients using real‐world data. METHODS: A Markov model with Monte‐Carlo microsimulations was developed to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of patients treated in first‐line with sunitinib versus pazopanib. Transition probabilities were estimated using observational data from a Canadian database where real‐life clinical practice was captured. The costs of therapies, disease progression, and management of adverse events were included in the model in Canadian dollars ($Can). Utility and disutility values were included for each health state. Incremental cost‐utility ratio (ICUR) and incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for a time horizon of 5 years, from the Canadian Healthcare System perspective. RESULTS: The cost difference was $36,303 and the difference in quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) was 0.54 in favour of sunitinib with an ICUR of $67,227/QALY for sunitinib versus pazopanib. The major cost component (56%) is related to best supportive care (BSC) where patients tend to stay for a longer period of time compared to other states. The difference in life years gained (LYG) between sunitinib and pazopanib was 1.21 LYG (33.51 vs 19.03 months) and the ICER was $30,002/LYG. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the model with a high probability of sunitinib being a cost‐effective option when compared to pazopanib. CONCLUSION: When using real‐world evidence, sunitinib is found to be a cost‐effective treatment compared to pazopanib in mRCC patients in Canada.

AB: Background: Rituximab is only approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment in patients with an incomplete response or intolerance to others DMARDs, including TNF alfa inhibitors. It represents a significant advance in RA biologics arsenal due to its safety and efficacy profiles. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of rituximab in RA patients and to compare the response between first‐line rituximab patients and those previously exposed to other biologics. Methods: An observational retrospective study was conducted, including all the consecutive patients with diagnosis of RA under rituximab, followed at our Rheumatology department until December 2016. Demographic and clinical data were obtained by consulting the national database (Reuma.pt). DAS28 variations and EULAR response were measured at 6, 12 and 18 months. Parametric and non parametric tests were used for statistics (SPSS 20.0). Results: We included 63 RA patients (81% of women), with a mean (SD) age of 61 (10) years and a mean disease duration of 19 (10) years; 86% rheumatoid factor positive and 87% anti‐ citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) positive. Bone erosions and extra‐articular manifestations were present in 85,7% and 58,7% of the patients, respectively. At baseline, the mean DAS28 was 5.79 (65% and 29% of patients with severe and moderate disease activity, respectively, and 6% in clinical remission). Thirty patients were treated with rituximab as first‐line therapy and 33 patients were previously exposed to other biologics. Combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) was observed in 48% and with others classic DMARDs in 30%, while 22,3% received rituximab monotherapy. First‐line rituximab option was justified by lung involvement in 21%, past malignancy in 13%, recurrent infections in 5%, congestive cardiac failure in 3%, vascular involvement in 3% and untreated latent tuberculosis in 3%. In the group previously exposed to biologics, 13% switched therapy due to ineffectiveness and 87% due to adverse events. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of age, gender, concomitant use of MTX and baseline DAS28. The group previously exposed to biologics had a longer disease duration (mean 23 vs 15 years, p=0.001) and fewer patients with ACPA seropositivity (79% vs 97%, p=0.035). There was a significant reduction of DAS28 at 6, 12 and 18 months (p<0.001 for all). Fifty six percent of the patients achieved a EULAR response at 6 months, 46% at 12 months and 59% at 18 months. DAS28 variation at 6 months differed significantly between groups, with a better clinical response in naive biological patients comparing to those previously exposed to biologics (median 1.173 vs 0.477; p=0.038). There were no differences in terms of DAS28 variation at 12 and 18 months (p=0.642 and p=0.135, respectively) and in EULAR responses at 6, 12 and 18 months between the groups (p=0.289, p=0.523 and p=1.000, respectively). Conclusions: Our study confirms the effectiveness of rituximab in RA patients and suggests a higher magnitude of response in naive biological patients at 6 months of RTX therapy. These findings put in perspective an extension of rituximab as a first‐line biologic for RA treatment.

AB: Background: Despite the socioeconomic importance of allergic rhinitis (AR), very few prospective studies have been performed under conditions of clinical practice and with a sufficiently long observation period outside the clinical trial scenario. We prospectively estimated the direct and indirect costs of AR in patients attending specialized clinics in Spain. Methods: Patients were recruited at random from allergy outpatient clinics in 101 health centers throughout Spain over 12 months. We performed a multicenter, observational, prospective study under conditions of clinical practice. We analyzed direct costs from a funder perspective (healthcare costs) and from a societal perspective (healthcare and non‐healthcare costs). Indirect costs (absenteeism and presenteeism [productivity lost in the workplace]) were also calculated. The cost of treating conjunctivitis was evaluated alongside that of AR. Results: The total mean cost of AR per patient‐year (n = 498) was 2326.70 (direct, 553.80; indirect, 1772.90). Direct costs were significantly higher in women (600.34 vs 484.46, P = 0.02). Total costs for intermittent AR were significantly lower than for persistent AR (1484.98 vs 2655.86, P < 0.001). Total indirect costs reached 1772.90 (presenteeism, 1682.71; absenteeism, 90.19). The direct costs of AR in patients with intermittent asthma (507.35) were lower than in patients with mild‐persistent asthma (719.07) and moderate‐persistent asthma (798.71) (P = 0.006). Conclusions: The total cost of AR for society is considerable. Greater frequency of symptoms and more severe AR are associated with higher costs. Indirect costs are almost threefold direct costs, especially in presenteeism. A reduction in presenteeism would generate considerable savings for society. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB: Background: During the course of ALS various assistive devices (AD) are required. The provision of AD (PAD) is characterized by high demands and multifunctional needs. Despite the high relevance of PAD, only a few systematic data have been reported. Objectives: This study aims to map PAD in ALS by assessing the standard of care, identifying key challenges in the provision process, and to analyze the distribution of AD in ALS; in order to identify standards of care and to categorize challenges in PAD. Methods: In 5 ALS centers in Germany, PAD is realized using a managed care concept and digital management platform (www.ambulanzpartner.de). PAD data obtained between April 2011 and March 2015 were analyzed. Indications for AD, the frequency and rejection rate of AD in ALS was obtained. Results: In 1494 ALS patients 11,364 AD were coordinated. AD groups are distributed as follows: wheelchairs 17%, n = 1909; bathroom adaptations 14%, n = 1594; orthotics 13%, n = 1446; communication devices 9%, n = 1066; AD for decubitus prevention 8%, n = 894; transfer devices 6% (n = 718); electrically operated beds and bed frames 6% (n = 653). Highest rejection rates relate to stair lift systems (59.8%), ramps (47.9%), motorized movement trainer (45.5%), communication devices (41.1%), and wheelchairs (40.7%). Electric wheelchairs were significantly more often rejected (52.5%) than manual wheelchairs (29%). Failures in PAD were related to the decision‐making of health insurers (40.4%) or patients themselves (23.4%). In 15.5% of PAD, the patient had died before AD delivery. Conclusion: PAD in ALS was dominated by complex AD including wheelchairs, orthotics, and communication devices. Nonprovision of AD related to the decisions of health insurers or patients was a main challenge in PAD. Standardized PAD procedures may contribute to decrease in the rejection of AD and the latency in PAD. The results of the study underline the need to include AD in ALS treatment guidelines.

AB: Purpose: Trastuzumab, a humanized anti‐human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (anti‐HER2) antibody delivered intravenously, has revolutionized the treatment of patients with breast cancer overexpressing HER2 protein. Recently, a newer subcutaneous formulation was shown to have comparable efficacy to the initial intravenous trastuzumab. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of subcutaneous trastuzumab on the health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients diagnosed with early or metastatic HER2‐overexpressing breast cancer. Methods: Patients were provided with the EORTC QLQ‐C30 (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire‐Core 30) and the BR‐23 questionnaires. The scoring of questionnaires and patient's sociodemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics were recorded and analyzed by descriptive and correlation statistics employing t test and 2‐way analysis of variance. Results: A total of 163 patients agreed to participate in the study. About 90 of 163 patients (55.21%) received subcutaneous trastuzumab and 21 patients intravenous trastuzumab (12.88%). A control group of 52 HER2+ patients received chemotherapy without trastuzumab (31.90%). Patients receiving subcutaneous trastuzumab were older and of more advanced disease stage compared with those receiving chemotherapy (58.5 vs 51 years, 39.8% vs 28.8% advanced disease). In univariate analysis, subcutaneous trastuzumab was associated with less nausea and vomiting (P =.002) but worse cognitive function (P =.013) and dyspnea (P =.042). Patients who have received >8 cycles of subcutaneous trastuzumab reported less diarrhea (P =.049) and systemic therapy side effects (P =.015). Multivariate analysis showed that patients without comorbidity receiving subcutaneous trastuzumab had less treatment side effects, less upset by hair loss, and higher emotional functioning. Of note, mastectomy and subcutaneous trastuzumab were associated with improved role functioning (P =.021). In metastatic disease, no negative impact of subcutaneous trastuzumab on HRQoL was found. Conclusions: The administration of subcutaneous trastuzumab improved certain symptoms and did not adversely affect most of the assessed functional scales. Particularly, in the metastatic setting, subcutaneous trastuzumab had no negative impact on HRQoL. Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

AB: Background: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD‐TPI) is comprised of an antineoplastic nucleoside analog, trifluridine, and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil. Compassionate use programs (CUPs) provide a treatment option for patients with unmet medical needs and an early opportunity to obtain data on efficacy, safety and use in a real‐world setting. Methods: Patients were registered and approved to receive 2 cycles of trifluridine/tipiracil treatment, which could be renewed as necessary, we analysed baseline characteristics, safety results and exposure to the treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD‐TPI) in the Spanish CUP. Results: A total 636 were registered in Spain and 538 received treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil. Median age was 64 years, of which 25% were older than 70 years old and 60% were male, 67% of pts were ECOG PS 1. Oral trifluridine/tipiracil was initiated at 35 mg/m2bid. Most pts had received 2, 3, or >=4 lines of prior treatment for metastatic disease (27%, 28%, and 38%, respectively); and 4% unknown. 275 (47%) patients had KRAS mutated and 209 (36%) had KRAS wild type. 35% received adjuvant chemotherapy and 20% of the patients were treated with regorafenib in previous lines. The main reasons for not initiating treatment included cancellation of request due to worsening condition and progressive disease. Treatment was generally well tolerated. A total of 173 AEs were reported in the Spanish CUP, the majority were myelosuppressive AEs; febrile neutropenia (grade >=3) was reported in 6 pts (1.3%), grade > 3 neutropenia was reported in 56 (33%), grade 4 neutropenia in 16 (9%). Grade 3 anemia was reported in 8 (15% of the total AEs reported).The majority of pts 306 (56%) were allocated 3‐4 cycle of treatment, 95(17.3%) 5‐6 cycles, and 30(5. 5%) between 7‐8 cycles. Conclusions: Thisreal‐world data analysis is consistent with those reported in phase 3 trials of trifluridine/tipiracil (FDTTP) in pretreated mCRC. The efficacy analyses of this population is planned.

AB: Background: Final results from the randomised phase III METEOR trial confirmed a survival benefit of cabozantinib over everolimus in patients (pts) with advanced clearcell renal cell carcinoma who progressed after at least one previous antiangiogenic inhibitor. The EAP provided the opportunity to treat pts in real world clinical practice. Methods: Data were collected from 92 pts treated with Cabozantinib across 23 Italian hospitals. Cabozantinib was available, upon physician request, from September to December 2016. Pts were aged 18 years and older, with mRCC and measurable disease, with Perfomance Status (ECOG) 0 to 2, who had relapsed after one or more prior systemic treatment. 74 pts had clear‐cell RCC, while the other 18 had non‐clear‐cell histologies (type II papillary and chromophobe). The most frequent site of disease were: lung 54 (58%), lymph nodes 42 (45%), bone 28 (31%), liver 15 (16%) and brain 5 (5%); 43 (46%) of pts had two or more sites of disease. Cabozantinib was administered orally at 60 mg once a day in 28 days‐cycles. Dose reductions to 40 or 20 mg were allowed if toxicity was encountered. Pts were monitored for adverse events (AEs) using CTCAE v.4.0. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the safety and activity of Cabozantinib in a large unselected population. Results: Cabozantinib was administered as second line therapy in 28 (30%) pts, as III line in 18 (19%) pts and as further lines in the remaining 46 (51%) pts. At the time of our analysis, grade 3 and 4 AEs were observed in 21% of pts. Among 91 pts, only 5 (5%) pts discontinued treatment due to AEs. The best overall response was partial in 28 cases (31%), whereas 23 (25%) pts had stable disease and 23 (25%) had progressive disease. 18 pts (18%) are not available for first response assessment. With a median follow‐up of 4 months, the median progression‐free survival observed was 3.5 months irrespective of the line of treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Cabozantinib is safe and active in a large unselected population treated according to everyday clinical practice.

AB: Background: Heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent condition particularly in the elderly. Prognosis has improved in HFrEF due to the availability of evidence based treatments. Currently, no treatments have proven efficacy in HFpEF patients and also in HFmrEF, the new category of HF, recently introduced by the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology. Purpose: to evaluate treatments at discharge in a real world setting of elderly patients after an episode of acute HF in the three different groups of HF: HFpEF, HFrEF and HFmrEF. Methods: data derived from the ATHENA retrospective observational study which included elderly patients (≥ 65 years) admitted with diagnosis of AHF to a tertiary University teaching‐hospital in the period 01.12.2014‐01.12.2015. Results: study population was composed by 246 patients: 19.5% with HFmrEF, 30.5% with HFrEF and 50.0% with HFpEF. Mean age of three group of patients was respectively 83.8, 84.5 and 79.9 years, p<0.001. Pharmacological treatments at discharge in the three HF groups are shown in the attached table. BBs and MRAs were the only two classes of drugs that had a statistically different prescription rate across the three HF groups: patients with HFmrEF received BBs in similar percentage to patients with HFrEF. MRAs prescription rate in HFmrEF was intermediate compared to the other two groups. Furthermore, the average number of drugs taken by patients at the time of discharge was 11.8 with no differences across the groups. Conclusion: at present, in the absence of specifical evidences from randomised clinical trials, patients with HFmrEF are treated similarly to those with HFrEF. Also, a high percentage of patients with HFpEF receive treatments that only have been to improve prognosis in HFrEF patients. Randomised clinical trials evidences are needed to appropriately treat HFmrEF patients. (Table Presented).

AB: Background: The objective was to compare patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who were included in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (trial participants) with patients who were not included (nonparticipants) on a trial‐by‐trial basis and according to indication for PCI. Methods: In this cohort study, we compared patients with IHD who were randomized in RCTs in relation to undergoing PCI in Denmark between 2011 and 2015 were considered as RCT‐participants in this study. The RCT‐participants were compared with contemporary nonparticipants with IHD undergoing PCI in the same period, and they were identified using unselected national registry data. The primary end point was all‐cause mortality. Results: A total of 10,317 (30%) patients were included in 10 relevant RCTs (trial participants), and a total of 23,644 (70%) contemporary patients did not participate (nonparticipants). In all the included RCTs, nonparticipants had higher hazard ratios for mortality compared to trial participants (P <.001). Among all patients treated with PCI, the pooled estimates showed a significantly higher mortality rate for nonparticipants compared to trial participants (hazard ratio: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.88‐2.19) (P <.001). When patients were stratified according to indication for PCI, the pooled estimates showed a significantly lower mortality rate for trial participants compared to nonparticipants in all strata (P for all <.001). Conclusions: Trial participants in recently performed RCTs including patients undergoing PCI were not representative of the general population of patients with IHD treated with PCI according to clinical characteristics and mortality. The difference in mortality was found irrespective of the indication for PCI. Thus, results from RCTs including patients undergoing PCI should be extrapolated with caution to the general patient population. Copyright © 2018

AB: Background: Adjuvant tegafur/uracil (UFT) chemotherapy is recommended for patients with completely resected Stage I non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Japan. A Phase III trial, the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) 0707, comparing the survival benefit of UFT and S‐1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) for this population is being conducted. However, the selection of patients in the randomized clinical trial (RCT) may not represent the real‐world population. The present study aimed to investigate the pattern of care for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected NSCLC. Methods: Patients with completely resected pathological Stage I (T1 > 2 cm and T2 in 6th TNM edition) NSCLC eligible for the JCOG0707 trial but excluded from it during the enrollment period (2008–13) were eligible for this study. Physicians from institutions that participated in the JCOG0707 retrospectively assessed the medical records of each patient. Results: This study enrolled 5006 patients, 85% of those initially considered for participation in the JCOG0707 trial (5006 of 5923 patients). Among them, 2389 were ineligible for the trial and 2617 had not been enrolled despite being eligible. The most frequent reason for non‐enrollment despite eligibility was the decline in patients’ participation, and the major reasons for trial ineligibility were concomitant malignancy and comorbidities. Of all the patients enrolled in our study, 1659 received adjuvant chemotherapy, mainly UFT. Conclusions: Our study indicates that only 15% of the real‐world patients with completely resected NSCLC were enrolled into the adjuvant chemotherapy RCT, and among those not participating in the trial, one‐third received adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB: Background: The PFS advantage of bevacizumab combined to EGFR‐TKI (A+T) over EGFR‐TKI monotherapy in 1st line treatment of advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC was firstly reported in phase 2 randomized trial JO255671 and newly demonstrated in phase 3 randomized trial NEJ0262. However, this combination had not been evaluated in the real world, the influential factor of PFS was not sure, and we knew little about the acquired resistance which is of great importance to the subsequent therapy, thus we conducted this study to address these medical needs. Method: A total of 30 advanced EGFR mutant (Del19/L858R) NSCLC patients who received Bevacizumab plus Erlotinib/Gefitinib from March 2014 to July 2017 in Hunan Cancer Hospital were enrolled in this analysis. Clinical information was fully collected. NGS (Burrning rock biotech, 168 genes panel) was applied to detect genetic aberration in both tissue and blood samples, in a dynamic pattern: tissue test before treatment and at progression; blood analysis before treatment, at first radiography evaluation, at the last radiography evaluation before progression and at progression. Results: All patients benefited from this combination. The overall response rate (ORR) was 77% and the median progression survival m(PFS) was 16 months. Neither baseline brain metastasis nor concomitant TP53 mutation shortened PFS (with vs without, 16 m vs 16 m, p=0.79; 17m vs 13m, p=0.34). Of EGFR mutation analysis by NGS, the concordant rate was well enough, 70% (21/30) between the paired initial tissue and blood samples. At progression, T790M was defined as the domain acquired resistance mechanism, contributing 43.8%, followed by MET amplification (12.5%), ERBB2 amplification (6.3%), high abundance of SMAD4 mutation (6.3%). Subgroup analysis showed patients with SMAD4 mutation have shorter PFS compared with those without SMAD4 mutation (10m vs 16m, p=0.035), while EGFR amplification did not impact PFS (17m vs 16m, p=0.60). Conclusion: The efficacy of A+T combination was encouraging in the clinical practice and the PFS data 16m in the overall population is consistent with what observed in clinical trials. Patients with baseline brain metastasis & concomitant TP53 and EGFR amplification at progression benefited similar in PFS compared to those without these characters. T790M and MET amplification are the domain acquired resistance mechanism. SMAD4 mutation was regarded as novel resistance mechanism, with PFS shorter than 1 year. We will do a continuous observation on A+T combination in the real world. Reference 1, KATO T, et al. 2014 ASCO Abstract 8005#. 2, Furuya N, et al. 2018 ASCO Abstract 9006#.

AB: Purpose: Randomised trials have shown that empiric ICD programming, using long detection times and high detection zones, reduces device therapy in ICD recipients. However, there is less data on its effectiveness in a “real‐world” setting, especially secondary prevention patients. Our aim was to evaluate the introduction of a standardised programming protocol in a real‐world setting of unselected ICD recipients. Methods: We analysed 270 consecutive ICD recipients implanted in a single centre—135 implanted prior to protocol implementation (physician‐led group) and 135 after (standardised group). The protocol included long arrhythmia detection times (30/40 or equivalent) and high rate detection zones (primary prevention lower treatment zone 200 bpm). Programming in the physician‐led group was at the discretion of the implanter. The primary endpoint was time‐to‐any therapy (ATP or shocks). Secondary endpoints were time‐to‐inappropriate therapy and time‐to‐appropriate therapy. The safety endpoints were syncopal episodes, hospital admissions and death. Results: At 12 months follow‐up, 47 patients had received any ICD therapy (physician‐led group, n = 31 vs. standardised group, n = 16). There was a 47 % risk reduction in any device therapy (p = 0.04) and an 86 % risk reduction in inappropriate therapy (p = 0.009) in the standardised compared to the physician‐led group. There was a non‐significant 30 % risk reduction in appropriate therapy (p = 0.32). Results were consistent across primary and secondary prevention patients. There were no significant differences in the rates of syncope, hospitalisation, and death. Conclusions: In unselected patients in a real‐world setting, introduction of a standardised programming protocol, using long detection times and high detection zones, significantly reduces the burden of ICD therapy without an increase in adverse outcomes.

AB: Background: Depression that does not respond to antidepressants is treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). TRD definitions include assessments of treatment response, dose and duration, and implementing these definitions in claims databases can be challenging. We built a data‐driven TRD definition and evaluated its performance. Methods: We included adults with depression, >=1 antidepressant, and no diagnosis of mania, dementia, or psychosis. Subjects were stratified into those with and without proxy for TRD. Proxies for TRD were electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain, or vagus nerve stimulation. The index date for subjects with proxy for TRD was the procedure date, and for subjects without, the date of a randomly selected visit. We used three databases. We fit decision tree predictive models. We included number of distinct antidepressants, with and without adequate doses and duration, number of antipsychotics and psychotherapies, and expert‐based definitions, 3, 6, and 12 months before index date. To assess performance, we calculated area under the curve (AUC) and transportability. Results: We analyzed 33,336 subjects with no proxy for TRD, and 3,566 with the proxy. Number of antidepressants and antipsychotics were selected in all periods. The best model was at 12 months with an AUC = 0.81. The rule transported well and states that a subject with >=1 antipsychotic or >=3 antidepressants in the last year has TRD. Applying this rule, 15.8% of subjects treated for depression had TRD. Conclusion: The definition that best discriminates between subjects with and without TRD considers number of distinct antidepressants (>=3) or antipsychotics (>=1) in the last year.

AB: The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the safety and activity of cabozantinib in a large unselected population of patients with metastatic renal‐cell carcinoma (mRCC) progressing after prior treatments. Our data showed that cabozantinib is effective in a large unselected population of mRCC patients treated in everyday clinical practice. Cabozantinib was also safe and its toxicity profile was feasible and manageable. Background: The randomized phase 3 METEOR study confirmed a survival benefit of cabozantinib over everolimus in patients with metastatic renal‐cell carcinoma (mRCC) with disease that progressed after treatment with at least one previous antiangiogenic inhibitor. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the safety and activity of cabozantinib in an unselected population. Methods: Data were collected across 24 Italian centers. Cabozantinib therapy was initiated at physician request between September and December 2016. Patients with mRCC with disease that progressed after one or more prior systemic treatment were evaluated. Cabozantinib 60 mg was administered orally once daily. Doses were reduced to 40 mg or 20 mg in patients experiencing grade 3 or intolerable grade 2 adverse events (AEs). Results: Data from 96 patients were evaluated. Cabozantinib was administered as second‐line therapy in 28 patients (29%) and as third‐line therapy in 18 patients (19%), while the remaining 50 patients (52%) received cabozantinib in further treatment lines. Sixty‐six patients began therapy with the full dose of 60 mg. Because of poor performance status, 29 patients began therapy with a reduced dose of 40 mg and 1 patient with 20 mg. At the time of our analysis, grade 3/4 AEs were observed in 35 patients (36%). Only 5 patients discontinued treatment as a result of AEs. Partial response was observed in 35 patients (36%), whereas 33 (34%) had stable disease and 28 (30%) progressive disease. Median progression‐free survival was 8.0 months. Conclusion: Cabozantinib showed acceptable tolerability and activity in a large unselected population treated according to everyday clinical practice.

AB: Introduction: Data on APCC's effectiveness, safety and quality of life are relatively poor because of the rarity of patients with FVIII or FIX inhibitors, the small populations included in clinical trials and the relatively short follow‐up available. The FEIBA‐GO study was designed to capture longterm outcomes on effectiveness, safety and health‐related quality of life (HR‐QoL) in subjects receiving APCC in different settings in routine clinical practice. Primary objective is to describe the hemostatic effectiveness of APCC in different settings (prophylaxis and on demand, including patients on immune tolerance induction); most relevant secondary objectives aim at describing joint functionality outcomes, safety, HR‐QoL, daily activity level, acute and chronic pain associated with hemophilia, as well as healthcare resources used. Methods: The study is a prospective, non‐interventional, multicenter cohort study in patients with hemophilia A or B and high‐responding inhibitors treated with APCC. A hundred subjects are targeted for enrollment; treatment regimens are at the discretion of the attending physicians in accordance with routine clinical practice, either on early, secondary or tertiary prophylaxis or on demand, including patients treated with APCC during immune tolerance induction. The observation period per subject will be 4 years. Results: As of June 1, 2016, 40 centres have been qualified in 14 countries and 16 centres have been initiated. 27 patients have been enrolled at 14 open sites in 7 countries. Demographic data are available for the 27 patients enrolled so far and are presented for the first time. All patients have severe hemophilia A: 23 are caucasian, 1 african (3 missing). At the enrolment, 18 of them were on prophylaxis and 6 treated on demand (3 missing). Overall median age is 19 years (min‐max: 3‐71), 17.5 years in patients on prophylaxis (min‐max: 3‐71) and 39.5 years in patients on demand (min‐max: 22‐65). Overall median inhibitor titer at enrolment was 8 BU (min‐max: 1‐2410), 8 BU for prophylaxis (min‐max: 1‐92) and 12 BU in patients on demand (min‐max: 3‐35). Nijmegen modified Bethesda assay was used in 18 centres, while 4 used non‐modified Nijmegen Bethesda assay (5 missing). Six subjects (3 on prophylaxis, 2 on demand and 1 unknown) have been reported to have overall 13 target joints. Assessment for acute pain was performed in 12 patients and for chronic pain in 9 patients. Two of 12 patients assessed reported acute pain (both on demand). Two of the 9 patients in whom the assessment was performed reported chronic pain (treatment regimen missing). For one patient, information is not available and for another one it has been reported that pain assessment is not routine examination. Gilbert Score was assessed in 6 patients at screening. Discussion/Conclusion: This study will further enhance the information on long‐term effectiveness, HR‐QoL and safety of APCC across and beyond Europe in the real world on hemophilia A and B patients with high‐responding inhibitors under a variety of prescribing regimens in routine clinical practice.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.397
AB: OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review of prospective observational studies in patients with RA to examine the safety of TNF‐I in daily practice, with particular focus on malignancy, and serious and opportunistic infections. METHODS: Comprehensive searches of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ACR, EULAR and BSR conference abstracts were performed according to a pre‐specified protocol that excluded randomised controlled trials. Type and site of malignancies, as well as serious and opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, were extracted. Publications that reported incidence rates, standardised incidence ratios or measures of relative risk, such as incidence rate ratios, odds ratios or hazard ratios, were selected for random effects meta‐analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2039 papers and 1979 abstracts were identified, of which 48 and 21 respectively met the pre‐specified inclusion criteria. The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of overall malignancy from seven studies was 0.94 (95% CI 0.84, 1.05; I2 = 0.0%). In contrast, the meta‐analysis of serious infections had much higher heterogeneity, I2 = 40.9%, RR = 1.34 (95% CI 1.06, 1.62). CONCLUSIONS: This review included data from European, US and Japanese studies with >130,000 patient years of exposure. Data from such a large number of patients, often with extended follow‐up, overcomes the weaknesses of clinical trial data, specifically fewer patient numbers and usually shorter exposure times. Observational data has known weaknesses related to non‐randomisation such that statistical techniques have to be used to overcome differences between the exposed and reference cohorts. Despite such confounding factors, consideration of the available evidence leads to the conclusion that there is an increased risk of serious and opportunistic infections with TNF‐I, although no evidence of increased the risk of malignancy. Meta‐analyses of randomised controlled trials have come to different conclusions regarding both the risk of infections and of malignancy.

AB: Background: A nationwide, multi‐institutional survey was performed in 2015 and 2016 to analyse routine practice for myeloma patients outside clinical trials in Germany. Aims: We aimed to investigate implementation of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) into treatment of patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) in Germany. Methods: The analysis is based on a database built from university hospitals (UH), community hospitals (CH), office‐based hematologists (OBH). Anonymized data were collected online based on retrospective chart review. The completeness and the plausibility of the data were verified in real‐time and by online personal checks. We investigated which institutions initiated treatment in patients with ASCT, which were the characteristics for patients not‐considered eligible for transplantation, how stem cell mobilization was performed, how many patients dropped out before planned transplantation and what were the frequencies of tandem ASCT and ASCT for relapsed disease. Results: Data from 515 patients from 51 centres were available for the first half of 2015 and from 867 patients from 52 centres for the first half of 2016. There were 40% (2015) and 32% (2016) pts considered as eligible for ASCT in 1st line. Although the proportion of patients older than 69 years was not significantly different between health care providers in 2015 and 2016 (2015: 47%UH, 60%CH, 49%OBP/2016: 54%UH, 56% CH, 47%OBP), patients were considered more often transplant‐eligible in UH (2015: 49%/2016: 53%) than in CH (2015: 29%/2016: 21%) or OBH (2015: 45%/2016: 26%). In first‐line treatment, 52% of patients eligible for SCT received mobilization chemotherapy in addition to induction therapy. More than 80% of patients received a cyclophosphamide‐based chemotherapy in combination with G‐CSF for stem cell mobilization in 2015 and 2016. Most participating institutions aimed at collection of three sufficient stem cell transplants (2015: 48%/2016: 46%). Once patients completed stem cell mobilization, 92% continued to high‐dose chemotherapy and 92% of them received ASCT finally. 25% of transplant patients were treated with tandem ASCT in 1st line. In 2015, 8% of patients and 1% of patients in 2016 were considered eligible and were ultimately treated with ASCT for relapsed disease. The most frequent reason for transplant‐eligible patients not receiving ASCT were withdrawal of patients consent (first‐line: 15%, second‐line: 39%). Summary/Conclusions:With our current analysis of a nationwide survey performed with different health care providers in Germany we demonstrate that implementation of ASCT is strongly influenced by the institution initiating primary therapy. Age does not seem to impact usage of ASCT compared to concomitant disease or patients' and doctors' preferences. Patients predominantly collect three autologous transplants, enabling a possible tandem ASCT and ASCT for relapsed disease.

AB: Background: Nivolumab showed a survival benefit in a randomised phase III trial in pre‐treated mRCC. The EAP provided the opportunity to treat patients (pts) in real world clinical practice before market availability of the drug clinical practice. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the safety and activity of nivolumab in a real world setting. Methods: Nivolumab was available upon physician request for pts aged ≥18 years who had relapsed after a minimum of one prior systemic treatment for mRCC. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. Pts included in the analysis had received ≥ 1 dose of nivolumab and were monitored for adverse events using CTCAE v.4.0. Results: Totally, 389 pts were enrolled in the EAP across 95 Italian sites, median age was 65 years (range, 34‐ 85) with 70 (18%) aged ≥ 75 yrs. Pts had a clear‐cell RCC in 92% of cases, bone metastases in 50% and brain metastases in 8%, and received more than one previous line in 79% of cases. At the time of this analysis, median number of doses received was 10 (1‐31) and 82 (21%) pts were treated beyond progression. Among 389 pts, 18 pts (5%) discontinued treatment due to AE. The best overall response rate was 17% including one complete and 66 partial responses, whereas 121 (31%) had stable disease. With a median follow‐up of 7 months (range, 1 to 16), 6‐month and 9‐month survival rates were 83% and 77%, respectively. Response and survival rates were comparable among pts regardless age, presence of brain or bone metastases and number of prior therapies. Conclusions: This EAP represents the most extensive reported real‐world experience with nivolumab in pre‐treated RCC pts. These first data seem to confirm efficacy and safety data of the pivotal trial in a real world setting. Results in patient populations poorly (elderly or bone metastases) or not represented at all (brain metastases) in the pivotal trial encourage the use of nivolumab in these subgroups of RCC pts.

AB: Objectives: To characterize and describe treatment with ulipristal acetate (UPA) in a preoperative setting and to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) outcomes in a French population treated according to standard clinical practice. Materials and methods: Multicentre, prospective, non‐interventional study (PREMYA) of patients diagnosed with moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids and undergoing a preoperative treatment with UPA 5mg (Esmya). Patients were followed for a total of 15months (3months UPA treatment and 12months after). Data were collected approximatively every 3months according to centre usual visit schedule. Results: A total of 206 women were enrolled in France, of whom 197 were found to be eligible for data analysis. Physicians' assessments of patients' overall symptomatic changes, as measured on the Clinical Global Impression‐Improvement (CGI‐I) scale, indicated that 83.7% of patients were improved at end of treatment (month 3). On the patients' treatment benefit scale (PTBS), 94.7% of patients reported an improvement. These 2 measurements, pain and quality of life, remained improved after treatment cessation and during the entire period of follow‐up. Only 58.4% of patients underwent surgery within the timeframe of the study follow‐up of which the majority were of a conservative/minimal invasive nature. Conclusion: Many patients did not undergo surgery during the planned 12. months follow‐up period after treatment whereas all patients had an indication of surgery. All measurements of treatment outcome were markedly improved by 3 months of UPA 5. mg treatment. Clinical trial number: NCT01635452. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB: Objectives: To perform a cost‐effectiveness analysis comparing the use of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with that of sorafenib in the treatment of patients with intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. Methods: Patient‐level data were consecutively recorded and collected at three oncology centers in Italy. A propensity score matching was performed to compare patients with similar clinical characteristics who underwent TARE or sorafenib treatment. Clinical data from the matched cohorts were used to populate a Markov model to project, on a lifetime horizon, life years, quality‐adjusted life years, and economic outcomes associated with TARE and sorafenib for both intermediate and advanced HCC stages. Results: Starting from data covering 389 and 241 patients who underwent TARE and sorafenib treatment, respectively, the propensity score matching yielded a total of 308 matched patients. For intermediate‐stage patients, the model estimated for TARE versus sorafenib an incremental cost‐utility ratio of 3,302/QALY (incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of 1,865 per life year gained), whereas for patients in advanced stage TARE dominated (lower costs and greater health improvements) compared with sorafenib. Conclusions: From an Italian health care service perspective, TARE could be a cost‐effective strategy in comparison with sorafenib for patients with intermediate or advanced HCC. The results from forthcoming randomized controlled trials comparing TARE with sorafenib will be able to confirm or reject the validity of this preliminary evaluation. In the meantime, decision makers can use these results to control and coordinate the diffusion of the technology.

AB: Introduction: Hypoglycemia is a major barrier in achieving good glycemic control in patients with diabetes and affects quality of life. Objectives: To describe the association of diabetes complications with hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods: A sample of 114 patients with type 2 diabetes was randomly selected from the diabetes clinic at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and details on hypoglycemia and complications of diabetes were recorded. Data were analyzed by independent sample t test. Results: Out of 114 patients, 83.3% were females. Mean age and mean duration of diabetes were 56.5 (±12.4) years and 11.5 (±7.5) years respectively. The incidence of minor hypoglycemia during the previous month and major hypoglycemia during the previous year were 1.6 ± 3.5 and 0.13 ± 0.56 episodes per patient. Minor hypoglycemia was more frequent in patients with retinopathy (2.5 vs 1.3 episodes/month, P = 0.26), nephropathy (4.3 vs 1.4, P < 0.05), neuropathy (2.3 vs 1.2, P = 0.12), ischemic heart disease (3.1 vs 1.3, P = 0.24) and stroke (5.0 vs 1.5, P = 0.56). Major hypoglycemia was also more frequent in patients with retinopathy (0.29 vs 0.07 episodes/year, P = 0.20), nephropathy (0.33 vs 0.12, P = 0.36), neuropathy (0.22 vs 0.08, P = 0.27), ischemic heart disease (0.45 vs 0.06, P = 0.15) and stroke (0.33 vs 0.13, P = 0.53). Conclusion: Hypoglycemia is seen more frequently in patients with microvascular and macrovascular complications. Thus, less stringent glycemic targets should be advocated in patients with established microvascular or macrovascular complications.

AB: Objectives: Giant cell arteritis GCA is a form of vasculitis with an annual global incidence of 15 to 35 per 100000 people over 50 years old Symptoms overlap with other conditions resulting in delayed or incorrect diagnosis if left untreated it can provoke major complications notably vision loss or aortic aneurysms For decades high dose long term glucocorticoids were the only mainstay of treatment leading to serious adverse events for the vast majority of these patients such as diabetes osteoporosis heart disease or glaucoma Given the high unmet need a more effective and safer treatment is required for patients which will also reduce their dependence on steroids improve their quality of life and generate cost savings for the healthcare budget by avoiding major steroids related adverse events. Methods: GiACTA is the largest randomized double blind clinical trial ever conducted in GCA comparing tocilizumab ACTEMRA plus glucocorticoids on 26 week tapering vs glucocorticoids alone on either 26 or 52 week tapering A de Novo semi markov cost effectiveness model was developed to demonstrate the long term benefits in cost savings and quality of life by treating GCA patients with tocilizumab plus glucocorticoids instead of glucocorticoids alone The cumulative glucocorticoid dose and frequency of disease relapses observed in the trial was linked to adverse event rates costs and quality of life in order to quantify and compare the costs and benefits between the different treatment arms The cost effectiveness model extrapolated clinical and economic outcomes over a lifetime horizon taking into account real world data. Results: The study showed that tocilizumab combined with a 26 week glucocorticoid regimen more effectively sustained remission through one year compared to steroid only regimen without any new safety signals The cost effectiveness model showed that tocilizumab can be a cost effective treatment in GCA. Conclusions: Tocilizumab addresses the significant unmet need for patents with GCA by providing optimal control of the disease and by reducing their exposure to glucocorticoids The results of this analysis suggest that tocilizumab is a cost‐effective treatment for GCA.

AB: Introduction: In the randomized MPACT phase III trial the addition of nab‐paclitaxel (nab‐P) to gemcitabine (G) significantly improved overall survival in patients (pts) with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). The treatment effect with the drug combination was also seen in poor‐prognosis subgroups. Here we report on interim outcomes of a subset analysis in elderly mPC patients (pts) > 70 years (yrs) of a multicenter non‐interventional study in the Austrian clinical routine. Methods: Pts > 70 yrs with confirmed mPC who met the eligibility criteria were treated with nab‐P/G at a dose regimen of nab‐P 125mg/m2 plus G 1000mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 of every 28day cycle in its labeled indication and prospectively observed until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability of nab‐paclitaxel, secondary objectives were the objective response rate (ORR) and assessment of real life dosing in daily clinical routine. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: Between 5/2015 and 1/2018, 108 pts (median age: 75 years, range 71‐89; 57% male) were included across 20 sites. At baseline, 42% (27/64) had grade 2 and 50% (32/64) grade 3 disease; CA19‐9 was elevated in 87% of pts (76/87). A total of 474 treatment cycles were applied, 37% (173 cycles) on days 1/8/15, while 46% (218 cycles) were initiated at a reduced dose intensity (days 1/0/15). Median treatment duration was 4 cycles (range 1‐17). Pts' performance status was ECOG 0‐1 in 94% of administrated cycles. The ORR of this interim analysis was conducted in 62 pts and consisted of 45% partial responses, 42% had stable disease for a DCR of 87%. Median PFS was 5.1 months (n = 69). Nab‐P/G was well tolerated with 86% ad‐ verse drug reactions (393/455) being non‐serious, 11% (52/455) required hospitalization. Pts benefited from the scheduled dose regimen mostly on days 1/8/15 (n = 32) with a median PFS of 5.8 months. A less dose dense application mostly on days 1/0/15 resulted in a PFS of 5.1 months (n = 18). The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation (n = 85) were tumor progression (48%) or death in (18%); 6% of pts discontinued treatment due to toxicity. No new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: These preliminary real world data in mPC pts >70 yrs suggest a comparable tolerability and higher benefit from nab‐P/G when cross compared with the results from the phase III MPACT trial.

AB: Objectives: Real world data, compared to randomised controlled trial (RCT) data, provides evidence from real world scenarios. However, the absence of randomisation does not allow for an unbiased comparison between the treatment and the comparator. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of NOACs, and whether RCTs findings are generalizable to clinical practice in Scotland. Methods: National data on prescribing, hospitalisations and death for newly anticoagulated patients, with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) were linked. Patients 50 years or older were followed from first oral anticoagulant prescription to first clinical event or death. Censoring was applied to treatment switching. AF related outcomes observed with NOACs were compared with warfarin at 2 and 6 years. Observed confounding was adjusted for with the inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score method. Using a continuous treatment approach, hazard ratios were estimated, adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Results: At 2‐year follow‐up there were no differences in risk of ischaemic stroke for apixaban (HR 0.91; 95%CI 0.70‐1.18), dabigatran (HR 0.82; 95%CI 0.44‐1.53) and rivaroxaban (HR 1.15; 95%CI 0.92‐1.42) compared with warfarin. However, when comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin, increased risks of the composite endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism or all‐cause mortality (HR 1.19; 95%CI 1.08‐1.32), major bleeding (HR 1.28; 95%CI 1.11‐1.46) and all‐cause mortality (HR 1.23; 95%CI 1.10‐1.37); and reduced risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0.66; 95%CI: 0.47‐0.95) was observed. For all comparisons, results at 6‐year were consistent with those observed at 2‐year follow up. Conclusions: At 2 and 6‐year follow up, no risk differences were found for apixaban and dabigatran compared to warfarin. However, this was not the case for rivaroxaban. These results of longer‐term follow‐up diverge from those reported in RCTs, and may have implications on the cost‐effectiveness of these treatments in a Scottish setting.

DOI: 10.1055/s-0036-1597420
AB: Background: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common in patients with renal insufficiency and endstage renal disease, but clinical data on HCV therapy in this patient group is limited. The direct‐acting antiviral regimen of ombitasvir (OBV), paritaprevir (co‐dosed with ritonavir, PTV/r) with dasabuvir (DSV) with or without ribavirin (RBV) was approved in 2015 in Germany for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 (GT1) and 4 (GT4) infection. However, real‐world data on this regimen in patients with renal insufficiency and end‐stage renal disease is currently limited. Goals: In this analysis, we report the real‐world effectiveness and safety of OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV in patients with renal insufficiency in the German Hepatitis C‐Registry (DHC‐R). Methods: The DHC‐R is a non‐interventional, prospective cohort study with more than 300 study sites in Germany. Patients with an eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and chronic HCV GT1 or GT4 infection treated with OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV between February 1, 2014 and December 7, 2015 were analyzed. Effectiveness was assessed by SVR at post‐treatment week 12 or 24 (SVR12/24) and safety is reported in all patients that received at least one dose of study drug. Results: In total, 326 patients with renal insufficiency received OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV. 52/326 (16%) patients had moderate (eGFR 30‐60 ml/min/1.73 m2; n = 36) to severe (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2; n = 16) renal insufficiency (incl. 8 patients on hemodialysis). 85/326 (26%) had cirrhosis and 202/326 (62%) were treatment‐experienced. 61 (19%), 229 (70%), 7 (2%) and 29 (9%) were infected with HCV GT1a, GT1b, an unspecified GT1‐subtype or GT4, respectively. Of 193 patients who reached post‐treatment follow‐up, 96% (152/159) of patients with mild renal insufficiency and all patients (100%; 34/34) with moderate to severe renal insufficiency achieved SVR12/24. Adverse events (AE) were reported in 188/326 (58%) of patients, specifically in 109/160 (68%) who received RBV and in 79/166 (48%) who did not. The rate of treatment discontinuations due to AE was 6.3% (10/160) in patients treated with RBV and 0.6% (1/166) in patients treated without RBV. Clinically significant changes in renal function were not observed when comparing eGFR at baseline and end of treatment in the overall population (DELTA eGFR:‐2.1 (mean)+/‐ 10.8 (SD) ml/min/1.73 m2) or in different subgroups, incl. patients with severe renal insufficiency. Conclusions: In this real‐world cohort of HCV GT1‐and GT4‐infected patients, treatment of patients with renal insufficiency with OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV was well tolerated and achieved high rates of SVR, irrespective of baseline renal function.

AB: We evaluated the concordance between data derived from randomised controlled trials (RCT) and real world (RW) estimates of HbA1c and weight change after 24 weeks of treatment with a basal‐bolus (BB) compared with a premixed (PM) insulin regimen. Data were pooled from 8 RCTs examining BB (n=1893) or PM (n=1517) regimens. RW data were extracted from the UK primary care dataset for BB (n=7843) or PM (n=10,744) and propensity‐score matched 1:1 (n=6180). t‐tests were used in both to compute the mean differences between HbA1c and weight from baseline and ANOVA was used to compare between the populations. Both insulin regimens were associated with HbA1c reduction (‐0.31% [RW] and ‐1.4% [RCTs]) and weight gain (+0.29 kg [RW] and +2.96kg [RCT]) but there were no significant differences between BB and PM. Discordances in the pattern of treatment response were, however, observed between RW and RCT data for both insulin regimens, e.g., the expected relationship between baseline HbA1c and HbA1c reduction with either insulin regimen was more apparent in the RCT population compared with RW. Similar discordances were noted between baseline weight and weight change (Figure), and between baseline weight and glycaemic reduction. These results highlight discrepancies between RW outcomes vs. RCT results with respect to starting BB or PM insulin regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes. (Figure presented).

AB: Objectives: Vemurafenib is the first BRAF inhibitor indicated in unresectable or metastatic melanoma. French Real World Data, notably regarding use, effectiveness and safety of vemurafenib, were expected from Roche (Market Authorisation Holder, MAH) by the French Health Care Payer. Methods: MELBASE is a national, multicenter and non‐interventional cohort promoted by Paris public hospitals and INCa since 2012, collecting clinical data of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Data extracted from MELBASE on patients treated with vemurafenib monotherapy were collected from March 2013 to September 2015. Overall survival (OS, primary criterion) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. Prognostic factors of patients' survival were assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox models. External validity of study results was checked through Roche exhaustive data on vemurafenib distribution to community pharmacies. Results: Extracted data from 101 patients included by 18 centers were analyzed: men (60%), mean age (59+/‐15 years), ECOG < 2 (78%), disease stage IV (93%), M1c stage (66%), V600E mutation (70%). Vemurafenib was prescribed as first‐line treatment in 88% of patients for a median duration of 3.9 months (Q1‐Q3: 1.8‐6.6). Median OS was 12.0 months (CI 95%: 9.5‐18.3) in the whole population, 14.8 months (11.2‐not reached) if first‐line treatment, and 7.5 months (4.8‐nr) if > 2 lines. Median PFS was 5.4 months (4.4‐6.6) in all. M1c stage, symptomatic brain metastases, and vemurafenib starting at > 2 lines were associated with shorter survival. Over treatment duration, 408 toxicities were reported in 88 patients (87%), including 330 vemurafenib‐related toxicities (87 patients, 86%) and 24 serious toxicities (18 patients, 18%). No toxicity‐related deaths were reported. Conclusions: An effective collaboration between institution and MAH has been set up to provideevidence, in appropriate timelines, to Payer. Results from clinical development were supported with analysis performed on Real World Data from preexisting academic database.

AB: BACKGROUND: Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) recommend antithromboembolic treatment strategies for patients with AFib and acute coronary syndrome (AFibACS). Our study assessed how current guidelines are implemented in the metropolitan area of Berlin and which therapeutic options were chosen in light of stroke and bleeding riskin everyday practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 2008 and January 2012, we included 1,295 AFibACS patients in the AFibACS Registry, as part of the Berlin Myocardial Infarction Registry. Meanage of the patients was 76 years with numerous comorbidities (15.4% former stroke, 35.0% renal failure, 43.5% diabetes, 92.8% hypertension). Of all the patients, 888 were treated with stent implantation, 91 with balloon angioplasty, and 316 conservatively. Overall mortality was 11.6%, and 8.3% in stented patients. At hospital discharge, triple therapy was administered to 49.9% of stented cases. After adjustment, odds of receiving triple therapy were lower within creasing age and renal failure. Odds were higher after stent implantation, with a higher CHA₂DS₂‐VASc score, and with any AFib category compared to initially diagnosed AFib. Between 2008 and 2011, triple therapy increased from 33.3% to 49.8% for stented patients and did not change significantly for those treated conservatively or with balloon angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in AFibACS patients, antithrombotic treatment focused on dual antiplatelet therapy for ACS, rather than on anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention. Factors influencing therapy at discharge were age, renal failure, stent implantation, AFib category, and CHA₂DS₂‐VASc score. During the study period, triple therapy increased for stented patients.

AB: Background/Purpose: Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor approved for the treatment of RA. Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib have been shown in several randomized clinical trials.Aim of the study presented here was to assess the clinical tolerability and effectiveness of tofacitinib among RA patients in real life. Methods: Consecutive patients between June 2013 and April 2017 with RA who fulfilled the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria were included in a prospectively designed analysis of retrospective data. Patients were initiated on tofacitinib 5mg bid. The primary objective was to analyze the safety of tofacitinib in a real‐life cohort. Safety was assessed by the reasons to stop tofacitinib during follow up and changes of liver enzymes, hemoglobin, and creatinine. The secondary outcome was to analyze the frequency of and time to achieve low disease activity (LDA) and remission as defined by DAS28. Patients were stratified according to previous treatment with biologic agents (bio‐naïve versus bio‐experienced). Results: Overall, 144 patients were treated with tofacitinib. 83.9% of patients were pre‐exposed to at least one biologic agent. The average DAS28 at the initiation of tofacitinib was 4.42. 50.4% were rheumatoid factor and 49.0% were ACPA positive. The mean follow up was 1.22 years (range 4d ‐ 3.7 years). 89 (61.8%) patients remained on tofacitinib during follow‐up. The median time to stop tofacitinib was 95 days (range 4‐1106). Reasons to stop tofacitinib were: insufficient response (n=23), gastrointestinal symptoms (n=18), infection (n=5), myalgia (n=2), remission (n=2), headache (n=2), cough, blue finger syndrome, intolerance, heartburn, psoriasis, and increased liver enzymes (all n=1). Increased ALAT or ASAT > 2x ULN were detected in 3.3% and 4.4%, respectively. These elevated transaminase levels were transient in 50 and 60% of the cases, respectively. Hemoglobin decrease of >10% was detected in 15.1% of the patients and decreased lymphocytes < 500/ll in 3.4%. An increase of creatinine >20% was detected in 9.4%. 58.2% and 49.5% of all patients achieved LDA or remission after a median survival time of 319 and 645 days, respectively. These rates were significantly higher in patients naïve to biologic agents as compared to patients pre‐exposed to biologics (LDA: naïve 100% after mean 92d, pre‐exposed 34.8% after 434d, p <0.001; remission: naïve 83.3% after 132d, preexposed 44.9% after 692d, p=0.001). Conclusion: Tofacitinib is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with RA. Tofacitinib may induce high rates of LDA and remission in patients with active disease, even after use of one or more biologics, though the rate is significantly higher in patients naïve to biologics. Tofacitinib may be a valuable option in a treat to target approach. Our data point to benefits of an early use of tofacitinib in the therapeutic strategy.

AB: Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is an aggressive plasma cell disorder with poor outcome. We and others have previously demonstrated in a limited number of pPCL patients that novel agents and mainly bortezomib‐based regimens (BBR) improve response rates and surviVal; in addition, two recent prospective studies have confirmed the efficacy of lenalidomide‐dexamethasone and BBR respectively, followed by autologous transplantation (ASCT) in pPCL; however, the prognostic impact of the induction therapy was not eValuated in both studies. Herein, we explored the clinical characteristics and the impact of current treatments and biological markers on the outcome of an extended cohort of primary PCL (pPCL) patients treated upfront with novel agents, outside clinical trials. We analyzed the medical records of 50 patients with pPCL (M/F: 25:25; median age 65.5 years, range: 32‐86 years; IgG: 19, IgA: 9, light‐chain only: 14, IgD: 2, non‐secretory: 6; ISS1: 5, ISS2: 16, ISS3: 29) out of 2711 myeloma patients (1.8%), registered in the Greek Myeloma study group database, between 2000‐2015. Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status was >2 in 52% of patients; 77% of patients presented with lytic bone disease and 11% with bone or soft tissue palsmacytomas. Bence‐Jones protein was present in 68% of patients; 53% of patients had abnormal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); 28% had hypercalcemia and 68% had hemoglobin <10 g/dL; fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or conventional karyotype were aVailable in 32/50 (64%) patients; high risk features were present in 65% of patients; 60% of patients had CD56(‐) peripheral blood plasma cells; 49/50 patients received therapy: Thirty‐eight out of 49 (77.5%) patients received BBR, one patient was treated with the combination of melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide and 10 patients with conventional chemotherapy (C/T); 14/38 (37%) of patients treated with BBR and one patient treated with C/T underwent ASCT consolidation; one patient received in addition an allogeneic transplantation; 48/49 treated patients were eValuated for response: 38/48 patients (79%) achieved objective response (>PR) and 35% displayed at least very good partial response (>vgPR), including 17% complete responses (CR). Achievement of >vgPR significantly correlated with BBR followed by ASCT (p=0.02). Median time to response was 2 months (range 1‐11). After a median follow up of 61 months (95% CI: 34.5‐87.4), 38 (76%) patients have died (disease progression: 18, infection: 16, other causes: 4) and 12 patients remain alive. Early mortality (<1 month) occurred in 3/38 (6%) deceased patients; 31/38 patients who responded in induction treatment progressed; 27/31 patients who progressed received 2nd line treatment (lenalidomide‐based: 7, BBR: 16, C/T: 4). Progression‐free surviVal was 12 months (95% CI: 8.5‐15.4) and it was marginally longer in patients treated with BBR+ASCT vs. others (18 months vs. 10 months, p=0.07). Median OS was 17 months (95% CI: 13‐21 months) and it was double in patients treated with BBR+ASCT compared to others (33 months vs. 16 months); median surviVal after PCL progression was only 7 months (95% CI: 3‐11 months). In the uniVariate analysis, performance status, LDH, induction treatment with BBR, or treatment with BBR+ASCT and quality of response (>vgPR vs. <vgPR) were independent prognostic factors for OS. In the multiVariate analysis quality of response and LDH were the only significant predictors for OS (p<0.05). The median OS for patients who achieved >vgPR was 39 months (95% CI: 22‐55) vs. 13 months (95% CI: 9‐17) for those achieved <vgPR (p=0.02, HzR: 0.46). The median OS for patients with LDH >300 U/L was 11 months (95% CI: 7‐15 months) vs. 24 months (95% CI: 8‐40 months) for those with LDH <300U/L (p=0.03, HzR: 0.5). These real‐world data, based on the largest reported national multicenter series of pPCL patients to‐date, support that treatment with BBR plus ASCT is the best currently aVailable option that offers deep and durable responses and reduces early mortality in this setting. Quality of response and high LDH were the strongest independent prognostic factors for OS. We conclude that pPCL requires an aggressive upfront therapeutic approach with a bortezomib‐based regimen followed by ASCT that would lead to maximum response and eventually to prolonged OS.

AB: Objectives: Since 2013, the CEESP evaluates the efficiency dossier of innovative and high‐budget‐impact health products and publishes their opinions on the methodological compliance with their guidelines. HAS recommends that the economic evaluation is made under the real life conditions. The objective of this study is to review the published opinions for reinscription drugs and identify the use of real world data (RWD) and the related objections. Methods: All publically available HAS/CEESP decisions for reinscription were collected from the HAS website as per June 1st, 2018 and analysed using the database developed by HEVA HEOR (https://efficience2.heva‐heor.com). The use of RWD were classified in categories and quantified. In‐depth qualitative analysis was conducted in order to highlight the use of RWD and related objections. Results: Five published opinions were identified. Only one dossier used RWD to document effectiveness. HAS requested RWD to be considered to evaluate effectiveness for future evaluations in three out of the four remaining dossiers. The absence of RWD leaded only once to an objection (important). RWD were mostly used to evaluate the transposability of the simulated population with respect to real world practice, the target population, to define the comparators, to document the mortality and some of the costs, and to validate the model. RWD were barely used to document the quality of life as well as the safety. Conclusions: RWD was requested by the HAS in the majority of the reinscription appraisals in order to evaluate the effectiveness but this did not lead systematically to an objection. A future challenge will deal with evidence synthesis including randomized and real‐world data, in absence of HAS methodological guidelines, given the expected increased number of reinscription appraisals.

AB: Background and Aims Combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment was first approved IFN‐free regimen in Japan. Patients with severe fibrosis have the priority to be treated because of the facing risk for liver failure or HCC and ideally, treated by the safe drugs. In this study, we investigated the effect and safety for the patients with severe fibrosis. [Patients and Methods] Among 926 patients registered in our multicenter study, 532 patients were defined as severe fibrosis by Fib4 index3.25. First, we investigated the viral response among patients with and without severe fibrosis, and then in patients with severe fibrosis, we investigated the factors associated with SVR. To compare the viral response, Chi‐square test was conducted, and in factor analysis, Student's t‐test was used in continuous values, and Chi‐square test was used in categorical values in univariate analysis, and logistic regression analysis was conducted in multivariate analysis. P<0.05 was judged as statistically significant. [Results] To compare the viral response, patients with severe fibrosis showed basically lower response compared with those without though the differences were not significant, except at 8 weeks after start of treatment (96.9% in patients with severe fibrosis vs 99.5% in those without P=0.002) and SVR4 (90.5% in patients with severe fibrosis vs 95.1% in those without P=0.015). Among the factors associated with SVR12 in patients with severe fibrosis in univariate analysis (selected the factors that showed P<0.2; gammaGTP, HCV‐RNA, RVR, LDH, lymphocyte number, Fib‐4 index, sex), low gammaGTP (OR: 1.014; 95%CI: 1.004‐1000.000, P=0.005), high LDH (OR: 1.020; 95%CI: 1.005‐1.036, P=0.008), RVR (OR: 8.197; 95%CI: 1.650‐41.667, P=0.010), and male (OR: 3.390; 95%CI: 1.055‐10.870, P=0.040) were selected as independent factors in multivariate analysis. In these populations, serum albumin levels significantly increased as early as 4 weeks after start of treatment and gradually and steadily increased until 24 weeks after the end of treatment (P<0.05). In the safety profiles, there were no obvious differences in the dynamics of hematological data and liver injury, which is specific AE in this regimen (P=NS). [Conclusions] Combination treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir could be used safely in patients with severe fibrosis. In viral response, slightly slower response and early relapse were seen in patients with severe fibrosis. And in these populations, liver function could be improved in early phase after start of treatment, and might prevent the progression of liver failure.

AB: Objectives: This ongoing, long‐term, postapproval observational safety study uses existing CF registries' data to evaluate outcomes in pts treated with IVA in a real‐world setting. Here we present results of disease progression analyses using 2015 data from the UK CF Registry. Methods: Pts with a record of IVA use in the first year of commercial availability in the UK (2013), who continued treatment through 2015 and had no organ transplantation, were compared to comparator (COMP) pts with no IVA use record matched (=1:5) on age, sex, and genotype severity (eg, G551D mutation IVA pts were primarily matched to pts homozygous for F508del ineligible for IVA therapy). Outcomes included percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1), pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), PEx hospitaliza‐tions, body mass index (BMI), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), and CF‐related diabetes (CFRD). Results: IVA (N = 260) and COMP (N = 1,289) pts were similar in age, sex, lung function, and medication use in 2012. From 2012 to 2015, mean ppFEV1 change was +5.8 percentage points in IVAvs‐3.1 percentage points in COMP pts; mean BMI increase was 1.7 kg/m2 for IVA vs 0.6 kg/m2 for COMP pts. The proportion of IVA pts experiencing PEx decreased from 54.6% to 35.4%, compared to an increase from 46.3% to 56.4% in COMP pts. Other outcomes are summarized in the Table. Conclusion: In addition to maintained improvements in lung function and nutritional status, as well as decreased risk of PEx and PEx hospitalizations, pts treated with IVA had a lower prevalence of DIOS and CFRD relative to COMP pts. These results support disease modification by CFTR modulator therapy. [Table Presented].

AB: A survey was conducted to investigate the standard of care for multiple myeloma in Germany, in order to clarify the status of implementation of international and national treatment guidelines. In addition, the changes in disease management over time were investigated by comparison with surveys conducted in 2008 and 2009. The survey captured a representative sample of 478 myeloma patients with a mean age of 67.9 years across various stages of the disease. Diagnostic approaches, prognostic aspects and treatment decisions were evaluated based on a survey conducted in 2011 in 58 representative centres in Germany, including university and non‐university hospitals and office‐based haematologists. Data were collected from chart reviews and were analysed retrospectively. Over time, an increasing number of patients were investigated for cytogenetic abnormalities (53%). Age <69 years and lack of comorbid conditions were major determinants for cytogenetic testing. Bortezomib/chemotherapy‐based regimens have become the preferred first‐line treatments independent of planning autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in first‐line therapy. Thalidomide‐ and lenalidomide‐based combination therapies are typically used as second‐line treatments in 31% of patients. Compared with previous reviews, the frequency of ASCT was stable, at ~30% of patients. Younger age and indicators of more severe disease, such as the presence of CRAB criteria, influenced the decision in favour of performing ASCT. Compared to previous surveys, the requirement for erythropoietin and granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor, as well as transfusions of red blood cells and platelets, respectively, have decreased considerably. In summary, novel agents have led to a substantial change in the first‐line and relapsed treatment approaches. Age and comorbidities remain major factors influencing treatment decisions, but cytogenetic testing to investigate myeloma‐related risk profiles is increasingly integrated. The use of novel agents has affected supportive care, with reduced necessity for substitute blood products and reduced administration of bone marrow‐stimulating factors.

AB: Objectives: To compare‐in a real‐world setting‐the frequency of bleeding events, myocardial infarctions and strokes in patients receiving warfarin versus dabigatran for atrial fibrillation.‐To evaluate whether the main results of randomized clinical outcome trials and of a national surveillance system can be replicated by a federated EMR based network for a fraction of their costs and duration. Methods: TriNetX, a federated global health research network, was used to analyze electronic medical records (EMR) of > 1 Million patients with atrial fibrillation (ICD10 I48). Patients were included if they started either warfarin or dabigatran between November 2010 and May 2014. Non‐rheumatic cardiac valve diseases, kidney transplant status and end stage renal disease were excluded. Events were defined by ICD10 codes after start of therapy: Bleeding by having either one of 23 ICD10 codes describing various cerebral, gastrointestinal, or other hemorrhages, stroke by I63, and myocardial infarction by I21. Results: 42,130 patients with warfarin (W) and 7480 with dabigatran (D) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. 41% (W) and 34% (D) were female. Mean age was 76 (W) and 72 (D) years. Mean INR and aPTT were 1.85 and 39.9 (W) versus 1.37 and 40.4 (D), respectively. 12.5% (W) and 2.3% (D) had a bleeding event, 15.9% (W) and 12.2% (D) had a stroke or myocardial infarction. Both differences were statistically significant (p= 0.0001). Conclusions: Dabigatran patients were on average four years younger and had significantly fewer bleeding events and significantly fewer cardiovascular events than patients with warfarin. This real world study conducted on electronic medical records (EMR) of large unmatched populations could confirm the results of randomized clinical trials and of an FDA sponsored, mainly claims based national surveillance system. The access to laboratory values, by using EMR rather than claims data, added value for internal validation, i.e. coagulation parameters.

AB: Objectives: The temporal trends in key outcome measures in CF patients treated with ivacaftor were explored by comparing the 30‐month periods prior to and post‐commencement of ivacaftor treatment. Methods: There were 114 patients registered with the CRFI with 30 months of data post‐commencement. Of these, 55% were male and 53% were over 18 years of age at commencement of treatment. The outcome measures analysed were FEV1% predicted, BMI and the total number and cumulative duration of pulmonary exacerbations in the pre‐and post‐commencement of treatment periods. The trends in pulmonary exacerbation outcomes were analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Temporal trends in FEV1% predicted and BMI were explored using mixed effects regression models, including covariates to adjust for baseline age, baseline FEV1% predicted and sex. Results: For this cohort, there were 820 pulmonary exacerbations in the 30 months prior to commencement of ivacaftor treatment, compared with 523 pulmonary exacerbations post‐commencement. There was also a reduction in the total duration of pulmonary exacerbations with on average 43 fewer days per patient post‐commencement of treatment (p < 0.001). The total number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation declined from 158 pre‐commencement to 109 hospitalisations post‐commencement of ivacaftor treatment. The total number of days of hospitalisation also declined from an average 16.8 days per patient to 13 days in the 30 months after treatment commenced (p =0.0301). Mean BMI and BMI z score increased over the treatment period (p < 0.001). There was also a significant improvement observed in FEV1% predicted, with an average increase of 7.7% (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our analysis has shown real‐world improvements in key outcome measures for CF patients treated with ivacaftor. FEV1% predicted and BMI both increased over the 30 month period, while there was a reduction in healthcare utilisation due to pulmonary exacerbations.

AB: Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) represents an incurable plasma cell malignancy. Success in the management of this disease requires a focus on prolonging disease control to positively impact survival. This is the rationale behind maintenance chemotherapy after frontline autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Recent large‐scale phase 3 randomized trials have shown daily low dose lenalidomide, an oral immunomodulator (IMID), has led to markedly improved progression free survival (PFS) and an evolving benefit on overall survival (OS). We sought to evaluate the effect of lenalidomide maintenance in patients with MM undergoing bortezomib‐based induction chemotherapy and ASCT in a real world setting. Methods Retrospective review of patients with MM undergoing initial bortezomib‐based induction chemotherapy and ASCT was completed in patients at our institution. Patients who began therapy up until June 30 , 2015 were included to ensure a minimum of 2‐yrs follow‐up. Patients were analyzed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Maintenance chemotherapy included those on lenalidomide alone or lenalidomide plus bortezomib, the latter being a treatment option at our centre for high‐risk patients. OS was measured from the time induction therapy was started until death or last follow‐up. PFS was measured from the time of induction therapy initiation to relapse, death or last follow‐up. Maximal response to treatment was assessed according to the IMWG consensus criteria although an additional endpoint of near CR (nCR) was included to account for patients where the monoclonal protein on electrophoresis disappeared and light chains normalized but where CR was not confirmed with immunofixation and a bone marrow biopsy was not done. Results 198 patients were included in the analysis. 121 received lenalidomide based maintenance and 77 received no maintenance between December 2004 to June 30 , 2015. Median ISS score was 2 in both groups without significant difference between them (p=0.98) . In the maintenance and no maintenance groups respectively 32% and 36% had ISS stage 3 disease. The mean number of maintenance cycles received was 25 cycles (0.5 ‐ 84). Sixty percent of patients required dose reductions or discontinuation due to adverse effects excluding relapse. Most commonly this was due to cytopenias (29.8%), rash (10.7%), infection (9.1%) and fatigue (5.8%). 15% discontinued therapy before relapse occurred. Though venous thromboembolism and second primary malignancies (SPMs) are a worry in patients treated long term with IMIDs these were only seen in 3.3% and 1.7% of patients respectively. Median follow‐up in the maintenance group was 44 months and 60 months in the no maintenance group. Survival data is shown in figure 1. The median OS was not reached in the maintenance cohort and was 89 months in the no maintenance group (p = 0.01). Estimated 3‐year OS was superior in the maintenance group at 88.4% versus 80.5% in the no maintenance cohort. A statistically significant difference in median PFS was also noted favouring the lenalidomide maintenance (55.0 months versus 32.9 months, p=0.002). Of patients treated with lenalidomide‐based maintenance 95.0% achieved ≥ VGPR (53.7% ≥ nCR) while 77.9% (29.1% ≥ nCR) of those who did not receive maintenance therapy achieved these endpoints (p=0.03). Further characterization of therapy for relapsed disease as well as PFS after 1 relapse (2 PFS) and time to second relapse (PFS2) will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions Our retrospective analysis of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in MM patients treated with bortezomib‐based induction chemotherapy and ASCT illustrates the positive impact lenalidomide has had on both PFS and OS. Patients treated with lenalidomide at our centre experienced a more prolonged and profound remission of their disease. The treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected adverse effects. Rates of thromboembolic disease and SPMs were low. Most importantly, the superior OS in the maintenance arm suggests that second line therapy for those not receiving maintenance could not overcome the negative impact of an earlier relapse. This data supports our ongoing approach incorporating lenalidomidebased maintenance continued until progression for all patients who have undergone an ASCT. Importantly, these real world results validate the phase 3 trial experience, helping to further establish this approach as a standard of care.

AB: Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy with 30, 330 estimated new cases in the US in 2016. The International Myeloma Working Group recommended that intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates be initiated in all patients with active MM administered at 3 to 4‐week intervals. However, there are limited data to date on the real‐world use of bone target agents (BTA; zoledronic acid and pamidronate disodium) in MM. The primary goal of this study is to describe current real‐world BTA treatment patterns. Methods: A database of electronic medical records from >1 million patients treated at approximately 220 cancer centers across the United States, OSCER (Oncology Services Comprehensive Electronic Records, generated by Flatiron Health), was used to identify individuals 18 years or older diagnosed with MM (ICD‐9 203.00; ICD‐10 C90.00) with at least 1 clinic visit within 1 month of diagnosis date between January 1, 2009 and March 31, 2016. Timing of BTA administrations, frequency, schedule, and changes/discontinuation were calculated, renal function, and BTA treatment relative to anti‐MM therapy regimens was also determined. Results: During the study period, 11, 099 patients were diagnosed with MM; most were male (55%), white (59%), and 65 and older at diagnosis (66%). Through the end of the follow‐up period (median follow‐up: 687 days), 64% of patients received >1 administration of a BTA (% consistent across study period) and zoledronic acid was the predominant BTA (93% of patients received >1 administration). The mean time from MM diagnosis until first BTA was 105.7 days (median: 29, IQR: 11‐78). In more recent years, the time to BTA initiation decreased. Initial BTA treatment occurred in first year after MM diagnosis in 58.7% of patients. By calendar year of diagnosis, the percentage of patients that ever received BTA treatment had decreased over time (2009‐2010: 72.3%; 2011‐2012: 68.0%; 2013‐2014: 63.6%). Most BTA administrations were dosed on a Q4W schedule (77%), particularly in the first year of MM diagnosis (84%). A total of 2, 350 patients (33.2%) either discontinued or changed BTA dosing scheduling through the end of follow‐up. Approximately 54% of patients that received a first line anti‐MM therapy received BTA concomitantly; in second line, concomitant BTA was 59%, and in third line, 55%. Conclusions: Real‐world data from oncology practices across the US indicate that approximately two‐thirds of MM patients received BTA treatment, and the treatment rate did not increase in more recent years. Additionally, few patients continued BTA beyond 2 years. Among BTA treated patients, BTA initiation occurred at approximately 3.5 months after diagnosis, and the majority of administrations followed a Q4W schedule with zoledronic acid. Further work will explore reasons for non‐treatment and treatment discontinuation with particular attention given to potential contraindications such as renal impairment, and the added burden of IV therapy in MM.

AB: Background: The combination of lenalidomide/dexamethasone (LenDex) is an established treatment for relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients; however, apart from clinical trials, there is limited data for the efficacy of this combination as 2nd line treatment. Furthermore, the efficacy of LenDex when administered before evident clinical manifestations, namely in the case of biochemical relapse as compared to clinical relapse, has not yet been assessed. Aims: In the current study, we evaluated response rates and progression‐free survival (PFS) in patients treated with LenDex in 2nd line and we compared survival parameters for patients treated with LenDex at biochemical relapse vs those treated at clinical relapse. Methods: Medical files of 207 patients with MM diagnosed between 2000‐2013 in 18 Greek centers and treated with LenDex as 2nd line treatment from January 1st 2009, up to March 1st 2014, were retrospectively studied. Overall response and PFS were evaluated for all patients. Additionally, PFS was compared in patients treated at either biochemical relapse (group A) or at clinical relapse (group B). The prognostic significance of biochemical relapse adjusted with important patients' characteristics was also evaluated. Classical methods were used for statistical analysis. Results: Two hundred and seven patient files were recorded and analyzed (M/F: 112/95, median age: 67.2y, range 31‐91y, IgG: 115, IgA: 55, Light chain: 22, non‐sectretory: 2, IgD: 5, IgM: 1, unknown: 7, ISS I: 54, ISS II: 74, ISS III: 77, high risk: 13%, standard risk: 87%). First line treatment included bortezomib‐ based regimens (63.3%), immunomodulatory drug‐based combinations (34.8%) and chemotherapy (40.1%); 25% of patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation; 2nd line treatment with LenDex was administered at biochemical relapse in 67.5% (95% CI: 61.1% <73.9%) of patients and at clinical relapse in 32.5% (95% CI: 26.1‐38.9) of patients. The overall response rate (ORR) was 73.4%; 23.7% of patients achieved very good partial response (VGPR) and 17.8% complete response (CR). The number of patients that achieved at least VGPR did not differ between the 2 groups (p<0.05). The median time to best response was 6.7 months (range 0.6‐ 51.9). After a median follow‐ up of 52.8 months, 112 (54.1%) patients are alive and 95 (45.9%) patients are deceased; 131 patients (63.3%) have relapsed (biochemical relapse: 66.4%, clinical relapse: 33.6%). Median PFS and PFS rate at 12 months was 19.2 months (95% CI: 15.6‐25.2) and 67.6% respectively. The median PFS was 24 months (95% CI: 18.0‐34.8) for patients in group A vs 13.2 months (95% CI: 8.4‐19.2) for patients in group B (HR: 0.63, p=0.006). When adjusted for important prognostic patients' characteristics (ISS, age, beta2 microglobulin, and LDH), biochemical relapse maintained its prognostic significance for PFS (p<0.05). Summary/Conclusions: Our data confirm that Lendex combination as 2nd line treatment leads to high overall response rates and prolonged PFS. Additionally, we have shown for the first time in routine clinical practice that MM patients who receive 2nd line therapy with LenDex at biochemical relapse have a significantly longer median PFS compared to patients treated at clinical relapse, underlining the importance of potentially starting treatment before evident clinical manifestations at the first relapse.

AB: Objective: Some concerns have arisen in subset and meta analyses of the pivotal trials regarding the negative effect of advanced age (>80 years) on outcomes after ET. Background: Recent randomized control trials have demonstrated superiority of endovascular therapy (ET) to medical management in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO). Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with proven LVO who underwent ET was conducted from January 2015 to June 2016. Patients were divided in two groups based on age (≥80 and >80 years) and were analyzed for degree of revascularization (TICI score) and functional status at discharge using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results: 54 patients received ET during the study period. Those who had posterior circulation LVO and/or treated after 6 hours from last known normal were excluded, leaving 34 patients for final analysis. Twenty‐two (64%) patients were <80 and 12 (36%) were >80. Seventy‐seven percent of patients ≤80 had favorable recanalization (TICI ≥ 2b) while 66 % of patients > 80 had TICI ≥ 2b (p value 0.69). Of patients >80 years, 0 % had a mRS <2 at discharge versus 36.3% ≤80 years (p value 0.03). Similarly, 25% of patients > 80 and 54.5% of <80 had mRS 3 or 4 (p value 0.15). Only 9% of ≥ 80 had mRS >4, as compared to >80 at 75% (p value <0.01). No statistically significant differences were found in the average time to revascularization, admitting NIHSS or administration of tPA. Conclusions: Age above 80 is a predictor of poor outcome after ET irrespective of successful recanalization. Our results confirm the questions raised in previous subset analyses. The reason octogenarians do poorly remains unclear, but our data suggests factors other than TICI score and time to revascularization. Focused randomized control trials are needed to get a definitive answer.

AB: Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer‐related death while accounting for only 3% of newly diagnosed cancer cases.[1] Nab‐paclitaxel (AbraxaneVR , Celgene) plus gemcitabine (nab‐P/G) has proven tolerability and superior efficacy as first‐line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPCa) compared to gemcitabine alone in the MPACT randomized phase III trial.[2] Real‐life clinical practice, however, is comprised of diverse treatment conditions and heterogenous patient populations. Here we report on prospective, non‐interventional real‐world data regarding the use of nab‐paclitaxel in mPCa patients (pts) in the Austrian clinical routine. Methods: Pts with confirmed mPCa who met the eligibility criteria were treated with nab‐P/G at a dose regimen of nab‐paclitaxel 125mg/m2 plus gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 of every 28day cycle in its labeled indication until progression and prospectively observed until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability of nab‐paclitaxel, secondary objectives were the objective response rate (ORR) and assessment of real life dosing in daily clinical routine. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: Between 5/2015 and 1/2018, 237 pts (median age: 70 years, range 44‐89; 55% male, 108 (46%)>70 years) were included across 20 sites, 219 pts were eligible for analysis. At baseline, 46% (67/145) had grade 2 and 46% (66/145) grade 3 disease; CA19‐9 was elevated in 85% of pts (161/190). A total of 1011 treatment cycles were applied, 46% (463 cycles) on days 1/8/15, while 34% (345 cycles) were initiated at a reduced dose intensity (days 1/0/15). Median treatment duration was 4 cycles (n=219; range 1‐17). Patients' performance status was ECOG 0‐1 in 96% of administered cycles. The ORR of this interim analysis was conducted in 145 patients and consisted of 43% partial responses (PR), 41% had stable disease (SD) for a disease control rate (DCR) of 83%. In the elderly cohort (>70, n=62), 45% had a PR and 42% had SD for a DCR of 87%. Median PFS was 5.1 months both in all pts (n=151) and in evaluated subgroups (‐/ >70 years, n=82/n=69, HR=0.941). Nab‐P/G was well tolerated with comparable rates of adverse drug reactions (495 vs. 455) in the respective subgroups (‐/>70 years), 86% (both) being non‐serious, 13 vs. 11% required hospitalization. Pts in both subgroups benefited from the scheduled dose regimen mostly on days 1/8/15 (n=41/ n=32) with a median PFS of 5.8 months. A less dose dense application mostly on days 1/0/15 resulted in a PFS of 6.1 vs. 5.1 months in pts‐ 70 vs.> 70 years (n=14/n=18; HR=0.82). The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation (n=171) were tumor progression (45%) or death in (19%); 5% of pts discontinued treatment due to toxicity. No new safety signals were identified. Conclusion: These preliminary real‐world data confirm the effectiveness and tolerability of nab‐P/G in the clinical routine treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients including a large cohort of elderly patients>70 years.

AB: The noninterventional study NABUCCO evaluated effectiveness and safety of nab‐paclitaxel in 697 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treated in routine care. The results confirm the clinical trial outcomes, the favorable benefit‐risk profile of nab‐paclitaxel, and the sustained global quality of life in patients with MBC in a real‐world setting. Background: One of the most effective chemotherapies for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is nab‐paclitaxel (nab‐P), which is approved for treatment of MBC after failure of first‐line therapy and when anthracyclines are not indicated. Randomized clinical trials have shown high efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Real‐world data of nab‐P in MBC, however, are still limited. Patients and Methods: The prospective multicenter noninterventional study NABUCCO collected data on the routine treatment of patients with MBC receiving nab‐P in 128 sites across Germany. The primary objective was time to progression. Secondary objectives were overall response rate, overall survival, safety, and quality of life. Results: Between April 2012 and April 2015, a total of 705 patients with MBC at 128 active sites had been enrolled. A total of 697 patients had evaluable data with a median follow‐up of 17.7 months. Median time to progression was 5.9 months (95% confidence interval, 5.6‐6.4), overall response rate was 37.2%, and median overall survival was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval, 14.2‐17.2). The results were similar in patients aged < 65 versus >= 65 years as well as in patients who received nab‐P on a weekly or a triweekly schedule. The most frequently reported grade 3/4 adverse events were leukopenia (55, 7.9%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (30, 4.3%), and infections (29, 4.2%). Patients reported no apparent treatment‐related impact on global quality of life. Conclusion: The results of the NABUCCO study confirm the clinical trial outcomes and the favorable safety profile of nab‐P in patients with metastatic breast cancer in a real‐world setting.

AB: Introduction: Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib represent the approved first‐line options for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)‐mutant non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because pivotal trials frequently lack external validity, real‐world data may help to depict the diagnostic‐therapeutic pathway and treatment outcome in clinical practice. Methods: MOST is a multicenter observational study promoted by the Veneto Oncology Network, aiming at monitoring the diagnostic‐therapeutic pathway of patients with nonsquamous EGFR‐mutant NSCLC. We reported treatment outcome in terms of median time to treatment failure (mTTF) and assessed the impact of each agent on the expense of the regional health system, comparing it with a prediction based on the pivotal trials. Results: An EGFR mutation test was performed in 447 enrolled patients, of whom 124 had EGFR mutation and who received gefitinib (n = 69, 55%), erlotinib (n = 33, 27%), or afatinib (n = 22, 18%) as first‐line treatment. Because erlotinib was administered within a clinical trial to 15 patients, final analysis was limited to 109 patients. mTTF was 15.3 months, regardless of the type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used. In the MOST study, the budget impact analysis showed a total expense of €3,238,602.17, whereas the cost estimation according to median progression‐free survival from pivotal phase III trials was €1,813,557.88. Conclusion: Good regional adherence and compliance to the diagnostic‐therapeutic pathway defined for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC was shown. mTTF did not significantly differ among the three targeted TKIs. Our budget impact analysis suggests the potential application of real‐world data in the process of drug price negotiation. Implications for Practice: The MOST study is a real‐world data collection reporting a multicenter adherence and compliance to diagnostic‐therapeutic pathways defined for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor‐mutant non‐small cell lung cancer. This represents an essential element of evidence‐based medicine, providing information on patients and situations that may be challenging to assess using only data from randomized controlled trials, e.g., turn‐around time of diagnostic tests, treatment compliance and persistence, guideline adherence, challenging‐to‐treat populations, drug safety, comparative effectiveness, and cost effectiveness. This study may be of interest to various stakeholders (patients, clinicians, and payers), providing a meaningful picture of the value of a given therapy in routine clinical practice.

AB: Background and Aims Combination therapy with daclatasvir and asunaprevir was first approved IFN‐free regimen in Japan. A weak point of this regimen is the relatively poor response in patients with resistant‐associated viral mutations (RAV), and this regimen is now avoided to use in many of these patients. However, even in patients without RAV, some cannot attain SVR. In this study, we investigated the effect of this regimen in patients infected with genotype 1b without RAV and factors associated with viral response. (Patients and Methods) Among 926 patients registered in our multicenter study, 730 patients were proved as RAV negative in both NS3 and NS5A, and included in this study. First, we investigated the viral response among patients with and without RAV, and in patients with RAV, and then, we investigated the factors associated with SVR. To compare the viral response, Chi‐square test was conducted, and factor anlaysis, Student's t‐test was used in continuous values, and Chi‐square test was used in categorical values in univariate analysis, and logistic regression analysis was conducted in multivariate analysis. P<0.05 was judged as statistical significant. (Results) To compare the viral response between baseline RAV‐negative and positive patients, on‐treatment response was significantly lower in RAV‐positive patients compared with RAV‐negative patients from 4 weeks after start of treatment and to the end of treatment (P<0.05), SVR12 (RAV negative; 552/601 (91.2%) vs positive; 42/56 (75.0%), P<0.001) and SVR24 (RAV negative; 400/436 (91.7%) vs positive; 31/43 (72.1%), P<0.001) were significantly different among these two populations. Among the factors associated with SVR12 in univariate analysis (selected the factors that showed P<0.2; gammaGTP, HCV‐RNA, Sex, Fib4 high, vRVR, RVR, WBC, AST, ALT, T. chol., prior treatment response), gammaGTP (OR: 0.993; 95%CI: 0.988‐0.998, P=0.005), RVR (OR: 9.009; 95%CI: 3.378‐23.809, P<0.001) were selected as independent factors in multivariate analysis. And among the factors associated with SVR24 in univariate analysis (P<0.2; gammaGTP, HCV‐RNA, Sex, Fib4 high, vRVR, RVR, Age75, eGFR, prior response), gammaGTP (OR: 0.990; 95%CI: 0.983‐0.996, P=0.002), male (OR: 2.786; 95%CI: 1.224‐6.329, P=0.015) and RVR (OR: 7.463; 95%CI: 2.364‐23.809, P=0.001) were selected in multivariate analysis. (Conclusions) In RAV negative patients, viral response was significantly higher than in RAV positive patients as reported previously. In RAV‐negative patients, baseline gammaGTP and RVR were important factors associated with SVR among the basic clinical indices.

AB: BACKGROUND: The non‐invasive Cxbladder urine test system has demonstrated clinical utility in ruling out urothelial carcinoma (UC) in patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH), suggesting that the number of invasive diagnostic tests, including cystoscopy, used in this patient population may be reduced by Cxbladder testing prior to conducting a full urological work‐up. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the enhanced clinical utility of communicating objective information on diagnostic decisions made by individual physicians on individual patients with AMH. METHODS: Three hundred ninety‐six physician‐patient decisions were generated from twelve participant physicians evaluating real world case notes from the same 33 patients presenting with AMH. Each physician reviewed and recommended diagnostic tests and procedures based on each patient's referral data and then re‐evaluated their clinical recommendation following disclosure of the non‐invasive Cxbladder urine test result. Changes assessed were the total number of requested diagnostic procedures and the number of invasive procedures, including cystoscopy, following addition of information from Cxbladder in the Triage and Triage and Detect modalities. RESULTS: Physicians made significant changes to their diagnostic behavior for patients with AMH when presented with Cxbladder test results, including a reduction in the number of total and invasive procedures including cystoscopy for individuals identified as having a low probability of UC. The intensity of investigation was targeted and increased, including use of total procedures and cystoscopy, for patients identified by Cxbladder tests as having a high probability of UC: urologists increased the level of investigation for both total procedures and invasive procedures. The outcome resulted in patients with a high risk of UC receiving appropriate guideline‐recommended invasive diagnostic tests. Patients who tested negative were offered fewer and significantly less invasive procedures. This change in physician behavior results in an increased clinical and patient utility, lower risk of missed UC and invasive test‐related harm incidents. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential for increased clinical resolution and significantly enhanced patient management, when physicians consider Cxbladder test results in their clinical evaluation. The change in physician behavior led to more appropriate diagnostic procedure selection and resource allocation to the benefit of both patients and healthcare systems.

AB: Objectives: The objective of this study was to document the burden and treatment patterns associated with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to Candida and Aspergillus species in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Methods: A retrospective chart review study was conducted using data recorded from 2011 to 2012 from hospitals in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Patients were included if they had been discharged with a diagnosis of IFI due to Candida or Aspergillus, which was culture proven or suspected based on clinical criteria. Hospital data were abstracted for a random sample of patients to capture demographics, treatment patterns, hospital resource utilization, and clinical outcomes. Descriptive results were reported. Results: Five hospitals participated and provided data on 102 patients with IFI (51 from Lebanon and 51 from Saudi Arabia). The mean age of the patients was 55 years, and 55% were males. Comorbidities included diabetes (41%), coronary artery disease (24%), leukemia (19%), moderate‐to‐severe renal disease (16%), congestive heart failure (15%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15%). Twenty percent of patients received corticosteroids prior to admission and 26% had received chemotherapy in the past 90 days. Inpatient mortality was 42%, and the mean hospital length of stay was 32.4+/‐28.6 days. Fifty‐five percent of patients required intensive care unit admission (17.2+/‐14.1 days), 37% required mechanical ventilation (13.7+/‐13.2 days), and 11% required dialysis (14.6+/‐14.2 days). The most commonly used first‐line antifungal was fluconazole. Conclusion: Patients with IFI in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon frequently have multiple medical comorbidities and may not have traditionally observed IFI risk factors. Efforts to increase use of rapid diagnostic tests and appropriate antifungal treatments may impact the substantial mortality and high length of stay observed in these patients.

AB: Introduction: Angiogenesis plays a fundamental role in breast cancer (BC) growth, progression and metastatic spread. After the promising introduction of bevacizumab for the treatment of advanced BC, the initial enthusiasm decreased when the FDA withdrew its approval in 2011. Nevertheless, several clinical studies exploring the role of bevacizumab have been subsequently published. Areas covered: The aim of this study is to review the available clinical trials exploring the potential effectiveness of bevacizumab in BC, regardless of the disease setting. Expert opinion: Even if the evidence suggests that bevacizumab must be ruled out from the HER2‐positive and adjuvant setting, bevacizumab's benefit remains uncertain in the neoadjuvant setting and in the advanced treatment of HER2‐negative patients. In the first setting, the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy increased the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in most clinical trials. However, the current absence of evidence that pCR is a trial‐level surrogate for survival requires waiting for long‐term results. In the advanced setting, all trials showed a benefit in progression‐free survival, but not in overall survival, highlighting an increase of adverse events. The lack of predictors of response represents the main unmet need in which future clinical research will undoubtedly invest. Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group

AB: Background: Recently, five randomized control trials have demonstrated superiority of endovascular therapy (ET) to medical management in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO). Some concerns have arisen in subset and meta analyses of the pivotal trials regarding the negative effect of advanced age (>80 years) on outcomes after ET. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with proven LVO who underwent ET was conducted from January 2015 to June 2016. Patients were divided in two groups based on age (≤80 and >80 years) and were analyzed for degree of revascularization (TICI score) and functional status at discharge using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results: Fifty‐four patients received ET during the study period. Those who had posterior circulation LVO and/or treated after 6 hours from last known normal were excluded, leaving 34 patients for final analysis. Twenty‐two (64%) patients were ≤80 and 12 (36%) were >80. Seventy‐seven percent of patients ≤ 80 had favorable recanalization (TICI ≥ 2b) while 66 % of patients > 80 had TICI ≥ 2b (p value 0.69). Of patients >80 years, 0 % had a mRS ≤2 at discharge versus 36.3% ≤80 years (p value 0.03). Similarly, 25% of patients > 80 and 54.5% of ≤80 had mRS 3 or 4 (p value 0.15). Only 9% of ≤ 80 had mRS >4, as compared to >80 at 75% (p value <0.01). No statistically significant differences were found in the average time to revascularization, admitting NIHSS or administration of tPA. Conclusion: Age above 80 is a predictor of poor outcome after ET irrespective of successful recanalization. Our results confirm the questions raised in previous subset analyses. The reason octogenarians do poorly remains unclear, but our data suggests factors other than TICI score and time to revascularization. Although ET has shown superiority in AIS with LVO, further consideration and careful selection is recommended in patients above age of 80. More focused randomized control trials are needed to get a definitive answer.

AB: Introduction. Real‐world data on long‐term safety and effectiveness in clinical practice of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) play an important role in the assessment of risks and benefits of this class of drugs and in supporting decision making process. Despite this, currently, the real world evidence on NOACs is still limited and available data refer mostly to administrative or insurance databases. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of major bleeding and cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort of patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) treated with apixaban identifies from 5 Italian hospitals. Objectives. Our primary objective was to evaluate the incidence of major bleedings during treatment with apixaban in patients with NVAF. As a secondary objective, we investigated the incidence of a composite endpoint of major events including all‐cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke and systemic thromboembolism. Methods. In this multi‐center, retrospective, observational study we collected data from clinical database on consecutive patients with a diagnosis of NVAF who had initiated apixaban from 1 January 2014 up to March 31, 2016. Several characteristics of the patients were collected including apixaban dosage, previous comorbidities and co‐treatments. The patients underwent up to 3 visits and the occurrence of several outcomes including cardiovascular outcome, death and bleeding were registered. The outcome incidence was calculated both as incidence rate (ratio between number of events occurred during follow‐up and personyears accounted by the entire cohort) and as cumulative incidence using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Results. The sample comprised of 766 patients with NVAF from five Italian hospitals. The mean age of patients was 74.2 years and 53.5% were women. The median CHADS2 and CHA2DS2‐VASc scores were respectively 2.0 and 4.0. The most frequent co‐morbidities were cardiovascular diseases (hypertension in 84% of patients; previous vascular disease in 34%; heart failure in 22%, renal impairment in 34%, diabetes mellitus in 22% and anemia in 12%). At baseline, 15.7% of patients had a history of at least one major event including stroke, transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism. In the whole cohort, half of patients (50.7%) were naïve to oral anticoagulants, while 219 patients had been previously treated with warfarin, heparin (66 patients), acetylsalicylic acid (52 patients), clopidogrel (1 patient) and a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC, 40 patients). At treatment initiation, 76.5% of patients received the recommended daily dose of 10 mg, while the remaining patients (23.5%) were treated with 5 mg daily. Over a follow‐up period of 3 years, 16 major bleedings occurred. The incidence rate of major bleedings (per 100 person‐years) was 1.19, while the cumulative incidence of major bleedings was 8.5% (95% IC 3.8%‐18.6%). With regard to the composite outcome, 26 major events were documented, including 20 deaths for any cause, 4 myocardial infarction, 4 cerebral stroke and 1 systemic thromboembolism. The cumulative incidence of composite outcome was 6.7% (95% IC 4.4%‐10.1%). Conclusion. In the present study, the rate of major bleedings and major thrombotic events in real‐life patients treated with apixaban was comparable to that found in randomized clinical trial.

AB: Background: the prognosis of patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has improved in recent years thanks to the availability of evidence based treatments. Currently, equally effective treatments are not available for patients with HFpEF (HF with preserved EF) and for those with HFmrEF (HF with mid‐range EF), the new category of patients with HF, recently introduced by the European Society of Cardiology. Purpose: to evaluate treatments at discharge in a real world setting of elderly patients after an episode of acute HF in the three different groups of HF: HFpEF, HFrEF and HFmrEF. Methods: data derived from the ATHENA retrospective observational study which included elderly patients (= 65 years) admitted with diagnosis of AHF to a tertiary University teaching‐hospital in the period 01.12.2014‐01.12.2015. Results: The final study population was composed by 291 patients: 19.9% of them with HFmrEF, 32.6% with HFrEF and 47.4% with HFpEF. Mean age of three group of patients was respectively 84.2, 84.3 and 80.3 years, p < 0.001. Pharmacological treatments at discharge in the three HF groups are shown in the attached table. BBs and MRAs were the only two classes of drugs that had a statistically different prescription rate across the three HF groups: patients with HFmrEF received BBs in similar percentage to patients with HFrEF. Instead MRAs prescription rate in HFmrEF was more similar to the one of patients with HFpEF. Conclusion: at present, in the absence of specifical evidences from randomised clinical trials, patients with HFmrEF are treated similarly to those with HFrEF. Also, a high percentage of patients with HFpEF, receive treatments that only have been to improve prognosis in HFrEF patients. Randomised clinical trials evidences are needed to appropriately treat HFmrEF patients (Table presented).

AB: Background: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts <100 x 109/L. Eltrombopag is an oral small‐molecule nonpeptide thrombopoietin‐receptor agonist that has shown to increase platelet production. It is approved for the management of patients with chronic ITP (aged >=1 year) who are refractory to other treatments (eg, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). The recommended eltrombopag dose in patients with chronic ITP is 25mg once daily, OD (East Asians, 12.5mg OD or 25mg every other day) in pediatrics aged 1‐5 years, and 50mg OD (East Asians, 25mg OD) in adults and pediatrics aged 6‐17 years at initiation, followed by dose adjustment to a maximum of 75mg OD based on platelet counts. REVIEU study was conducted in accordance with risk management plan in five European Union (EU) countries to document eltrombopag utilization patterns in real‐world practice. Here, we report the eltrombopag data on the subset of adult patients (aged >=18 years) with ITP as primary diagnosis. Aims: To evaluate the real‐world data to determine drug utilization patterns among adult patients with ITP receiving eltrombopag within five EU countries. Methods: REVIEU study was a multinational, multicenter, retrospective, medical chart review in patients with a documented past treatment with eltrombopag between the period immediately after first approval/launch in May 2010 and September 2014 (ie, dispensed at least once by the pharmacy and patient received at least one dose) for whatever reason. Patients who participated or were participating in a randomized eltrombopag clinical trial were excluded.(Table Presented) Results: Overall, 287 adult patients with ITP (chronic [>12 months], 75.3%; persistent [3‐12 months], 10.8%; acute [<3 months], 13.6%; unknown [n=1]) were included, majority in Spain (n=128) followed by Italy (n=67), Greece (n=36), France (n=29), and Germany (n=27). Eltrombopag was the first treatment with no prior ITP therapies in 12 (4.2%) [acute, 10.3%; persistent, 6.5%; chronic, 2.8%] patients. A total of 99 (34.6%) patients received one prior therapy (corticosteroids, 79 [27.6%]), 128 (44.8%) patients received two prior therapies (corticosteroids+immunoglobulin, 114 [39.9%]), and 47 (16.4%) patients received three prior therapies (corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, and splenectomy). In total, the majority of patients received at least one prescription of corticosteroids (252, 88.1%) followed by immunoglobulins (180, 62.9%), and splenectomy (64, 22.4%) prior to eltrombopag initiation. Patients received an average daily dose of eltrombopag 45.6mg (chronic ITP, 44.6mg; persistent ITP, 43.1mg; acute ITP, 53.0mg) during the study. Overall, dose changes were reported in 749 adult ITP prescriptions (down‐titration, 53.7%; up‐titration, 43.7%; no change in dose, 2.7%). 49.1% of dose changes were reported during the first 6 months of treatment (35% in first 3 months). The main reasons for dose change included: disease improvement (30.4%), no treatment response (26.8%) and others (27.1%). Disease improvement accounted for down‐titration in 51.2% (206/402) and up‐titration in 4.6% (15/327), and no treatment response for up‐titration in 54.4% (178/327) and down‐titration in 5.0% (20/402) of adult patients with ITP. Proportion of patients with platelet counts by ITP disease phase, and by eltrombopag dose are reported in Table 1. Summary/Conclusions: The majority of adult patients with ITP (75.3%) were diagnosed with chronic ITP, and were treated with eltrombopag as second‐line or greater therapy after corticosteroids and immunoglobulins, in line with the approved indication. Eltrombopag was also prescribed in 24.4% of adult patients with acute and persistent ITP. The starting dose followed the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) recommendations in the majority of cases and dose modifications were generally according to platelet counts. Data from REVIEU study have shown that eltrombopag use in the real world setting is largely consistent with the EU label and is considered part of ITP medical therapies.

AB: Background: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is highly prevalent in patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse; however historically, implementation of HCV treatment in this patient group in realworld remained challenging. With all‐oral, interferon‐free HCV regimens available and the favorable setting of opiate substitution treatment (OST), conditions are now potentially more adequate for successful HCV treatment in these patients. In clinical trials with OST patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 (GT1) infection, the regimen of ombitasvir (OBV), paritaprevir (co‐dosed with ritonavir [PTV/r]) with dasabuvir (DSV) and/or ribavirin (RBV) achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) rate of 96.4%. However, real‐world data on this regimen in this group is currently limited. Goals: In this analysis, we report the real‐world effectiveness, safety and adherence of the treatment regimen of OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV in patients receiving OST in the German Hepatitis C‐Registry (DHC‐R). Methods: The DHC‐R is a non‐interventional, prospective cohort study with more than 300 study sites in Germany. OST patients with HCV GT1 or GT4 infection treated with the regimen of OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV between February 1, 2014 and December 7, 2015 were analyzed. Effectiveness was assessed by SVR at posttreatment week 12 or 24 (SVR12/24), safety is reported in all patients that received at least one dose of study drug and overall adherence was assessed by quantification of medication taken. Results: In total, 67 OST patients received OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV, with 30 patients having reached posttreatment follow‐up. Among patients receiving treatment, 8/67 (12%) had cirrhosis and 31/67 (46%) were treatment‐experienced, predominantly to interferon‐based therapies. 39/67 (58%), 17/67 (25%) and 11/67 (16%) were infected with HCV GT1a, GT1b or GT4, respectively. All OST patients who reached post‐treatment follow‐up achieved SVR12/24 (100%; 30/30). Adverse events (AE), predominantly mild or moderate in severity, were reported in 43/67 (64%) of patients. Serious AE were rare (6.0%; 4/67) and treatment discontinuations due to AE were not reported. Overall adherence was very good (100% of medication taken in 27/34; 79%) or good (90‐100% of medication taken in 6/34; 18%) in the majority of patients. Conclusions: In this real‐world cohort of HCV GT1 and GT4‐infected patients, treatment of patients receiving OST with OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV was well tolerated and achieved high rates of overall adherence and SVR.

AB: Vemurafenib, ipilimumab and dabrafenib were registered for the treatment of advanced skin melanoma pursuant to the results of randomized phase III clinical trials. Real‐world data on survival time for patients treated with those drugs in daily clinical practice are so far limited. Patients with advanced skin melanoma treated under reimbursement programmes (drug programmes), for which they were qualified pursuant to uniform inclusion criteria in force in all oncology centres in Poland. Data were obtained from the electronic databases of the national payer (NFZ) responsible for the implementation and monitoring of reimbursement (drug) programmes. The analysis included all patients included for treatment with vemurafenib (since March of 2013), ipilimumab (since March of 2014) and dabrafenib (since July of 2015) until December 2016. The end date of the observation was set to 31 December 2016. The total survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan‐Meier estimator. Until 31 December 2016, 759 patients were treated with vemurafenib, 370 with ipilimumab and 181 with dabrafenib. The overall survival (OS) median was 9.8 months for patients treated with vemurafenib (95% confidence interval: 8.8‐10.6) and 6.9 months for patients treated with ipilimumab (95% confidence interval: 5.7‐9.2). For patients treated with dabrafenib, the OS median was not reached because of an overly short observation period. The probability of surviving 12 months in the group of patients treated with vemurafenib was 40.5%, ipilimumab was 35.1% and dabrafenib was 60.7%. The probability of surviving 24 and 36 months in the group of patients treated with vemurafenib or ipilimumab amounted to, respectively, 20.1, 15.4 and 21, 18.8%. OS of patients with advanced melanoma treated in daily clinical practice may be comparable to the ones achieved in registration trials. The use of appropriate treatment inclusion criteria may affect the obtained OS.

AB: Background: Although anthracycline‐based triplets are one of the most widely used schedules to treat advanced gastric cancer (AGC), the benefit of including epirubicin in these therapeutic combinations remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate both the efficacy and tolerance of triplets with epirubicin vs. doublets with platinum‐fluoropyrimidine in a national AGC registry. Methods: Patients with AGC treated with polychemotherapy without trastuzumab at 28 hospitals in Spain between 2008 and 2016 were included. The effect of anthracycline‐based triplets against doublets was evaluated by propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression. Result: A total of 1002 patients were included (doublets, n = 653; anthracycline‐based triplets, n = 349). The multivariable Cox PH regression failed to detect significantly increased OS in favor of triplets with anthracyclines: HR 0.90 (95% CI, 0.78‐1.05), p = 0.20035. After PSM, the sample contained 325 pairs with similar baseline characteristics. This method was also unable to reveal an increase in OS: 10.5 (95% CI, 9.7‐12.3) vs. 9.9 (95% CI, 9.2‐11.4) months, HR 0.91 (CI 95%, 0.76‐1.083), and (log‐rank test, p = 0.226). Response rates (42.1 vs. 33.1%, p = 0.12) and PFS (HR 0.95, CI 95%, 0.80‐1.13, log‐rank test, p = 0.873) were not significantly higher with epirubicin‐based regimens. The triplets were associated with greater grade 3‐4 hematological toxicity, and increased hospitalization due to toxicity by 68%. The addition of epirubicin is viable, but 23.7% discontinued treatment because of adverse effects or patient decision. Conclusion: Anthracyclines added to platinum‐fluoropyrimidine doublets did not improve the response rate or survival outcomes in patients with AGC but entailed greater toxicity.

AB: Background and Aims Combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment was first approved IFN‐free regimen in Japan. These drugs are mainly metabolized in liver, so this combination therapy could be theoretically used in patients with renal dysfunction safely. In this study, we investigated the effect and safety for the patients with renal dysfunction. (Patients and Methods) Among 926 patients registered in our multicenter study, 110 patients showed eGFR<50ml/min. and 44 patients showed eGFR<30ml/min. First, we investigated the viral response among patients with and without renal dys function (cut off of both eGFR: 30 and 50), and then in patients with renal dysfunction, we investigated the factors associated with SVR. To compare the viral response, Chi‐square test was conducted, and in factor analysis, Student's t‐test was used in continuous values, and Chi‐square test was used in categorical values in univariate analysis, and logistic regression analysis was conducted in multivariate analysis. P<0.05 was judged as statistically significant. (Results)To compare the viral response, patients with renal dysfunction showed basically higher response compared with those without, and these differences were especially clear in early response (2 weeks after start of treatment) in the analysis using cutoff at eGFR<30ml/min (88.2% in patients with eGFR<30ml/min. vs 59.7% in patients with eGFR30ml/min.). Among the factors associated with SVR12 in patients with renal dysfunction (eGFR<50ml/min.) in univariate analysis (selected the factors that showed P<0.2; Fib4 index categorized at 3.25 as significant fibrosis, RVR, RAV, lymphocyte number), only RVR (OR: 45.455; 95%CI: 1.524‐1000.000, P=0.028) was selected as an independent factor in multivariate analysis. In the safety profiles, there were no differences in the dynamics of hematological data, and liver injury, which is specific AE in this regimen, was rather lower in patients with renal dysfunction compared with those without (P<0.001). (Conclusions) Combination treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir could be safer and might have higher efficacy in patients with renal dysfunction compared with those without. Among the patients with renal dysfunction, only RVR was the predictive factor of SVR12.

AB: Background: Real‐world data (RWD) are increasingly valuable as a resource to measure the clinical relevance of therapies and healthcare interventions outside the randomised controlled trial (RCT). These data have progressed from small audits and individual patient case reports to large epidemiological registries. However, there is a need to develop a study design allowing for individual clinicians to include anonymised patient‐level data to such a mutual registry. Objectives: To establish a study methodology to determine RWD from patients prescribed Gla‐300 across National Health Service (NHS) organisations to assist clinical practice. Methods: In order to address the need to develop a regulation‐compliant database that can be used to generate robust, independent, collective, anonymised patient data in answer to clinically relevant questions, we developed this retrospective study, in conjunction with NHS clinicians, to standardise RWD collection from patients with Type 1 diabetes prescribed Gla‐300. The primary and secondary outcomes include change in levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from initiation of Gla‐300 to 6‐months' treatment, changes in weight, insulin dose and regimen, and hypoglycaemia frequency. A sample size of 300 patients (SPARTA) was estimated necessary to provide adequate power (99% confidence) to detect an HbA1c change of 0.5%. Regulatory approval was provided by the Health Research Authority. To date, eight participating centres are in the set‐up stages. Data will be collected over a 3‐month period. Conclusions: We present a collaborative study to record efficacy and safety RWD from patients prescribed Gla‐300 to augment the RCT evidence available to facilitate clinical decisions.Funding: Sanofi UK.

AB: Purpose: Cataract surgery is associated with increased inflammatory mediators, and other retinovascular changes that might increase risk of developing diabetic macular edema (DME) after cataract surgery. We wished to assess the rate of developing DME requiring treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab and the possible impact of cataract surgery in a large cohort for which there was a single electronic platform for capturing data consistently. Methods: Multicentre national DR database study with 3458 eyes receiving ranibizumab for DME. Data collected in the course of routine clinical care , anonymised data within an electronic medical record system were extracted remotely from 20 Centres. The minimum dataset included: age, visual acuity at baseline and at all subsequent visits, injection episodes, and timing of cataract surgery. Main Outcome Measures: Rate of developing 'injection‐requiring DME' in relation to timing of cataract surgery in the same eye. Results: The follow‐up period was median [IQR] 1 [0.2,2.3] years. During this period, 469 eyes underwent cataract surgery. The rate of developing 'injection‐requiring DME' in this cohort decreased prior to surgery (3.5% for the period 12‐9mths prior, 2.4% for 9‐6mths prior, 2.3% for 6‐3mths prior and 1.3% for 3‐0mths prior), but increased sharply after surgery, peaking in the 3‐6mths period (9.1% for the 0‐ 3mths period post‐op, 12.3% for 3‐6mths post‐op, 8.5% for 6‐9 mths post‐op and 5.7% for 9‐12mths post‐op). Conclusions: This real world dataset achieved at a large number of centres across the UK suggests that there may be an increased rate of developing DME requiring treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab. An alternative explanation is that this is purely an issue of visualization, however in the UK access to ranibizumab for DME is based on a minimum OCT‐measured central macular thickness, increasing the likelihood that our findings represent a real effect of cataract surgery on DME, rather than being due to improved visualisation alone. It is also possible that this post‐operative peak may be compounded by post‐operative CME in this relatively high‐risk group, and this is the subject of on‐going investigation.

DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2016.08.331
AB: Background In clinical practice, 40 mg/m2 of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD40) has been used as an initial dosage for treating recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) instead of the recommended dose of 50 mg/m2 (PLD50). However, no robust evidence is available to support the use of PLD40. This post‐hoc study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of initial PLD dosages in propensity score (P‐score)‐matched dataset. Methods The data source was a PLD postmarketing surveillance dataset (n = 2189) conducted in Japan. Eligibility criteria for the present study were as follows: recurrent OC, history of chemotherapy, and treatment with PLD monotherapy at a dosage between 35.5 and 54.4 mg/m2. Overall survival (OS) was compared between PLD50‐ and PLD40‐treated groups using the log‐rank test. Incidences of palmar‐plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) and stomatitis were also compared between the groups. Results Overall, 503 matched pairs were generated using P‐score analysis. The median survival time with PLD50 and PLD40 was 383 and 350 days, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.98‐1.26; p = 0.211), although the difference was not statistically significant in the P‐score‐matched dataset. However, the incidence and severity of PPE and stomatitis were significantly lower with PLD40. Conclusions Our study showed that the efficacy of PLD did not differ based on initial dosages, but the risk of adverse events was reduced with PLD40. Considering the balance between patient benefits and risks, our results support the use of PLD40 in clinical practice. Copyright © 2016 The Authors

AB: Adaptive Licensing (AL) is an ambitious and evolving new initiative which incorporates Real World Evidence (RWE): clinical data collected outside of a conventional randomized controlled trial. In 2014 EMA launched a pilot project to explore the adaptive pathways approach, a scientific concept of medicines development and data generation intended for medicines that address patients' unmet medical needs. AL is not a new route of approval for medicines. It makes use of existing approval tools, in particular conditional marketing authorization, which has been in operation in the EU since 2006. The adaptive pathways concept is not meant to be applicable to all medicines, but only to medicines that are likely to offer help for a patient population with an unmet medical need, and where the criteria for adaptive pathways apply. RWE refers to the planned and systematic recollection of the data generated outside the clinical studies. Adaptive approaches link decision making to an evolving evidence base, parts of which are frequently seen as being derived from analyses of observational data gathered from sources such as electronic medical records, registries or administrative databases. RWE data collection within AL has the potential to improve our understanding of disease processes, and epidemiological factors, which will in turn allow RCTs to become more efficient. Additionally, for many subpopulations, the life span approach to licensing and coverage and learning from real world experience as advocated by adaptive pathways will become the only viable access route to new treatments in future. Regulators have just begun to explicitly address and communicate “uncertainty” in their templates for benefit‐risk assessment. A growing number of regulators and payer (or HTA) organizations involve patients in their decision making processes. This can be considered as a pertinent analogy for the history of bringing new drugs to market.

AB: Introduction: Large patient outcome registries are a key part of the compendium of information typically mined to generate real‐world data and evidence. Real‐world evidence (RWE) derived from such registries via application of advanced data analytics therefore represents a potentially important aspect of the ongoing rational assessment and future development of commercially available spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices.We present here a prospective global registry designed to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of neurostimulation therapy for chronic pain. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter global registry (RELIEF Registry, Boston Scientific) that aims to assess various aspects of the pain treatment experience using SCS in up to 1,700 participants at up to 80 centers. These assessments will encompass pain relief, satisfaction, quality of life, safety, and other aspects associated with the real‐world clinical use of SCS. Eligible study participants are trialed for 'on‐label' use only with a commercially approved SCS system (Boston Scientific) and must sign an institutional review board‐approved informed consent form. All permanently implanted subjects are followed out to 36 months. Results: Results of the data analysis from initial cohorts evaluated from the Boston Scientific‐sponsored RELIEF registry will be presented. Conclusions: This multicenter, global registry collects and analyzes a large real‐world data set collected from patients using SCS for chronic pain. Previously, SCS has been shown to be an effective treatment option for chronic pain, as demonstrated in randomized controlled trials [1‐3]. This cohort now represents the first prospective global registry evaluating the real‐world use of SCS as a treatment approach for chronic pain.

AB: Background and Aims: Balloon Guide Catheter (BGC) use during thrombectomy treatment in Stroke patients has been reported to have positive effects on revascularization, procedural characteristics, and clinical outcomes. We evaluate the use of BGC in an open‐label large prospective TREVO Retriever Registry of real world patients to determine predictors of good 'clinical' outcomes. Method: Consecutive Trevo Registry patients that had Balloon Guide Catheter (BGC) used during their thrombectomy procedure were identified; a subset of patients who fulfilled the criteria (ICA and/or MCA‐M1/M2 occlusion with pre‐morbid mRS 0‐1, TLSW <=6 hrs) within the cohort were also identified. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the predictors of good outcomes in BGC thrombectomy patients. Results: A total of 1031 BGC treated Trevo Registry patients (overall enrolled, n=2010) qualified for analysis, of which 605 patients fulfilling the subset criteria were identified. The mean age of BGC/stent retriever patients was 67.5 with a median (IQR) baseline NIHSS of 15(11‐19). Occlusion location of the BCG group was ICA ‐20.4%, M1‐ 57.1%, M2/M3‐20.3%, and Posterior 1.8%. In the overall BGC cohort, the median (IQR) time to treatment was (4.2 (3.0,6.5)‐ hrs.) with conscious/local sedation used in 63.4% and general anesthesia used in 37.3% of cases. The median number of passes with Trevo stent retriever was 1 and revascularization (mTICI >= b) was achieved in 92.8% of cases. The sICH rate was low at 1.9% (20/1031) with a low rate of vessel perforation (0.2%). At 90 days post stroke, 56.0% of patients achieved functional independence (mRS 0‐2) with 63.7% of the subset of "guidline " BGC patients achieving functional independence at 90 days. Multivariate logistic regression showed age (aOR 0.97 [0.96, 0.99] P <0.001), Diabetes (aOR 0.67, [0.18,0.98] P =0.03), conscious sedation vs general anesthesia ( aOR 1.7 [1.2,2.3], P= 0.002, number of passes (aOR 0.76 [0.66‐0.88],P <0.001), pre stroke mRS (aOR 0.54 [0.45‐0.65], P <0.0010 and NIHSS (aOR 0.93 [0.91‐0.95], P <0.001) as predictors of functional independence . Conclusion: Data from Trevo Registry demonstrate the use of BGC in thrombectomy procedure is safe, and leads to a reduction of disability in ischemic stroke patients.

AB: Background: When designing studies it is common to search the literature to investigate variability estimates to use in sample size calculations. Proprietary data of previously designed trials in a particular indication are also used to obtain estimates of variability. Estimates of treatment effects are typically obtained from randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Based on the observed estimates of treatment effect, variability and the minimum clinical relevant difference to detect, the sample size for a subsequent trial is estimated. However, data from real world evidence (RWE) studies, such as observational studies and other interventional studies in patients in routine clinical practice, are not widely used in a systematic manner when designing studies. In this paper, we propose a framework for inclusion of RWE in planning of a clinical development programme. Methods: In our proposed approach, all evidence, from both RCTs and RWE (i.e. from studies in routine clinical practice), available at the time of designing of a new clinical trial is combined in a Bayesian network meta‐analysis (NMA). The results can be used to inform the design of the next clinical trial in the programme. The NMA was performed at key milestones, such as at the end of the phase II trial and prior to the design of key phase III studies. To illustrate the methods, we designed an alternative clinical development programme in multiple sclerosis using RWE through clinical trial simulations. Results: Inclusion of RWE in the NMA and the resulting trial simulations demonstrated that 284 patients per arm were needed to achieve 90% power to detect effects of predetermined size in the TRANSFORMS study. For the FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II clinical trials, 189 patients per arm were required. Overall there was a reduction in sample size of at least 40% across the three phase III studies, which translated to a time savings of at least 6months for the undertaking of the fingolimod phase III programme. Conclusion: The use of RWE resulted in a reduced sample size of the pivotal phase III studies, which led to substantial time savings compared to the approach of sample size calculations without RWE.

AB: We need to assess clinical treatments in real‐life settings outside of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Pragmatic RCT (pRCT) data can supplement RCTs by providing effectiveness information to support healthcare decisions. Electronic health records can facilitate concurrent safety monitoring and data collection without direct patient contact for large randomised study populations in pRCTs. The Salford Lung Study is the world's first phase III pRCT in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which aims to randomise over 7000 patients.

Methods: The survey tool, 35 qualitative and quantitative open‐ and closed‐ended questions, was developed iteratively with stakeholders (academia, health services, government bodies, patient organisations). The tool, available in English via Qualtrics from March 2017, included questions on the use of RWE for licensing and coverage recommendations, RWE ownership and the future of RWE. The survey was distributed to a selection of global contacts (n= 260). Results: We analysed preliminary results for 46 returned surveys. Respondents were from 20 countries and a variety of roles (academia, HTA bodes, clinicians and patient organisations). Over two‐thirds (69%, n= 24) thought it unlikely RWE would support licensing and market authorisation‐related decisionmaking, 91% (32) thought it more likely that RWE would have a role in national‐level HTA periodic re‐assessment. Less than 40% thought that RWE would ever play a similar role to RCT in drug evaluations, although 14 countries reported accepting lower levels of evidence for decision‐making. Respondents from Spain, Russia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, France and the UK saw potential in the use of RWE in regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical based decision‐making, economic evaluations and reassessment‐re‐review in the next 3‐5 years. Those from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Austria, Italy and Germany saw less potential. Barriers to RWE use included issues around lack of randomisation, lack of data availability and data quality. Conclusions: Whilst there are some differing opinions around the use of RWE for regulatory purposes, most respondents see it as a complement to RCT, rather than a replacement. The general opinion is that RWE will become more valuable over time if data quality and availability can be improved.

AB: Introduction: Large patient outcome registries are a key part of the compendium of information typically mined to generate real world data and evidence. Real world evidence (RWE) derived from such registries via application of advanced data analytics therefore represents a potentially important aspect of the on‐going rational assessment and future development of commercially‐available Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) devices. We present here a prospective global registry designed to evaluate long‐term effectiveness of neurostimulation therapy for chronic pain. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter global registry (RELIEF Registry, Boston Scientific) that aims to assess several various aspects of the pain treatment experience using SCS in up to 1700 participants at up to 80 centers. These assessments will encompass pain relief, satisfaction, quality of life, safety, and other aspects associated with the real‐world clinical use of SCS. Eligible study participants are trialed for “on label” use only with a commercially‐approved SCS system (Boston Scientific) and must sign an IRB‐approved informed consent form. All permanently‐implanted subjects are followed out to 36‐months. Results: Results of the data analysis from initial cohorts evaluated from the Boston Scientific‐sponsored RELIEF registry will be presented. Conclusions: This multicenter, global registry collects and analyzes a large real‐world dataset collected from patients using SCS for chronic pain. Previously, SCS has been shown to be an effective treatment option for chronic pain as demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (1‐3). This cohort now represents the first prospective global registry evaluating the real‐world use of SCS as a treatment apporach for chronic pain.

AB: SGLT2i, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have been shown to reduce the incidence of major adverse CV events (MACE), all‐cause mortality (ACM) and renal events in CV outcomes trials (CVOTs), with robust real‐world evidence (RWE) suggesting class effect benefits. In the exenatide CVOT EXSCEL, ~10% of patients took an SGLT2i with ~5% use of dapagliflozin (DAPA). Effects of all SGLT2i, and DAPA alone, on MACE, ACM, and eGFR were analyzed in EXSCEL participants randomized to placebo. Propensity‐matched cohorts (including by study visit) of SGLT2i users and non‐users (n=709 per group) were generated, based on their last measured characteristics before SGLT2i initiation. Subsequent time‐to‐first adjudicated MACE and ACM were compared using a Cox regression. Decline in expeneGFR over time (slope) was quantified in the matched cohorts using a mixed model repeated measurement (MMRM) analysis. SGLT2i overall, and DAPA alone, numerically decreased the MACE hazard ratio, and SGLT2i significantly reduced the ACM risk (Table). The eGFR slope was improved significantly for SGLT2i overall and DAPA alone (Table). This post‐hoc EXSCEL analysis supports a beneficial class effect for SGLT2i on MACE, ACM, and renal function, consistent with published CVOTs, Real‐World data, and for DAPA alone. DECLARE, the ongoing DAPA CVOT, will complete in 2018.

AB: Background: Sunitinib (SUT) has been reimbursed to treat patients with metastatic renal cell carcinomas (mRCC) in Taiwan since 2010 while limited knowledge exists on its effectiveness on survival. Objectives: To provide real‐world evidence on survival in Taiwanese SUT users with mRCC. Methods: Setting: We identified SUT users from the entire Taiwan RCC cohort with the Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patient Database between 2010 and 2012. Exposure: We grouped users according to their exposure status of other systemic treatment prior SUT and the time from the date of RCC diagnosis to SUT initiation. We defined patients that received SUT within 240 days after the date of RCC diagnosis as early users based on the standard of care in Taiwan. For SUT users that survived more than 90 days after treatment initiation, we divided at the median of the cumulative dose that they received within the first 3 months after SUT initiation to construct high‐dose (≥2.8 gm) and low‐dose (<2.8 gm) groups. Main Outcome Measure: Median overall survival (mOS). Statistical Analysis: We employed Kaplan‐Meier method to estimate mOS. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software 9.4. Results: We identified 872 SUT users that were diagnosed as RCC. The mOS was 456 days (95% CI: 403 to 516 days), significantly shorter than that reported in the randomized controlled trial (RCT) (792 days; 95% CI, 690 to 987 days). Among 761 treatment‐naïve SUT users, the mOS was 447 days (95% CI: 396 to 501 days). Compared with early initiators (patients that received SUT within 240 days after the date of RCC diagnosis), the mOS were significantly longer among late initiators (early initiators: 447 days, 95% CI: 384 to 518; late initiators: 715 days, 95% CI: 608 to 839). For patients that survived more than 90 days after SUT initiation, the mOS was significantly longer in the high‐dose group (the high‐dose group: 667 days, 95% CI: 568 to 872; the low dose group: 461 days, 95% CI: 402 to 564). Conclusions: The results of these real‐world analyses suggested that the mOS among Taiwanese mRCC population was significantly shorter than RCT‐based reports. Late initiation and a higher cumulative dose within the first 3 months of the treatment course were factors associated with the longer mOS.

AB: Background: Gout and osteoarthritis (OA) are common in the United States, but little is known about potential associations of OA and hyperuricemia/gout with clinical outcomes. Objectives: This study examined variations in gout severity, management, and healthcare utilization among gout patients with and without OA. Methods: Data were assessed from a survey of US physicians and patient chart audits. Participating physicians managed the care of >=50 patients with gout annually; chart audits were of their most recent 5 consecutive adult patients with confirmed gout. Gout severity was measured by physician global assessment, flares, organ/joint damage, and tophi. Treatment characteristics, presence of clinician‐confirmed OA, and sociodemographic factors were identified. Descriptive and multivariate (stepwise logistic regression) statistics analyzed the differences among gout patients with and without clinician‐confirmed comorbid OA, and assessed urate‐lowering therapy (ULT) use and gout control. Results: Overall, 1159 charts of gout patients were abstracted (230 w/ OA, 929 w/o; 81% male; 71% white); the proportion of patients aged >=61 was greater for those with gout and OA than those with gout but without OA (63% vs 32%; P<0.001). Patients with gout and OA had longer mean duration of gout (63 vs 41 months), were more likely to have tophi (44% vs 19%), joint damage (31% vs 11%), and clinician‐rated severe gout (31% vs 12%) than those without OA (all P<0.01). Patients with gout and OA were also more likely to receive ULT (89% vs 70%; P<0.01), and among those receiving ULT, OA patients treated with allopurinol received a higher average daily dose (325 mg vs 296 mg; P=0.031). Gout patients with OA were more likely to have additional comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, COPD, depression, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, prostate problems [men]) and have chronic pain than those without OA (all P<0.05). Gout patients with OA reported more office visits (4.0 vs 3.5), were more likely to have an emergency department visit (17% vs 9%), and were more likely to require surgery for gout in the past 12 months (3% vs 0.3%) (all P<0.01). In both groups, ULT use was associated with better gout control, but the specific factors predictive of ULT use and disease control varied between those with and without OA. Conclusions: Gout patients with OA were more likely to have a greater impact on health system spending, with additional comorbidities and more severe gout than those without OA. These data suggest that gout patients with OA constitute a less healthy group in need of more careful monitoring and more aggressive gout management.

AB: This second article in the series on pragmatic trials describes the challenges in selection of sites for pragmatic clinical trials and the impact on validity, precision, and generalizability of the results. The selection of sites is an important factor for the successful execution of a pragmatic trial and impacts the extent to which the results are applicable to future patients in clinical practice. The first step is to define usual care and understand the heterogeneity of sites, patient demographics, disease prevalence and country choice. Next, specific site characteristics are important to consider such as interest in the objectives of the trial, the level of research experience, availability of resources, and the expected number of eligible patients. It can be advisable to support the sites with implementing the trial‐related activities and minimize the additional burden that the research imposes on routine clinical practice. Health care providers should be involved in an early phase of protocol development to generate engagement and ensure an appropriate selection of sites with patients who are representative of the future drug users.

AB: Objective: Real‐world evidence (RWE) study publications are becoming increasingly important throughout the life of a medicine, however RWE studies are less well known than randomized controlled trials (RCTs), often referred to as the 'gold standard' of evidence. We aim to describe the pattern of knowledge of RWE in our industry, starting by asking ISMPP members for their views. Research design and methods: In December 2015, ISMPP emailed members a link to our online survey of 10 multiple‐choice questions about respondents' experience, attitudes (relative to RCTs) and understanding (terminology, policies, guidelines) regarding RWE publications. Results: Overall, 28 people responded to the survey (11 pharmaceutical industry employees, 17 medical communications agency or freelance medical writing professionals), most (71%) of whom indicated that they had 'lots' or 'some' experience of RWE publications. Compared with RCTs, most respondents said RWE studies are less robust (67%) and reporting of RWE studies is of a lower standard (59%). No respondent agreed with the statement '[RWE] terminology is clearly defined and used consistently'. In total, 79% of respondents said that their organization had no policy on RWE publications or they did not know whether there was a policy. Although most respondents (71%) used STROBE and similar guidelines for RWE study publications, 21% were not aware of these guidelines. Overall, 79% of respondents felt that current guidelines for publishing RWE were not sufficient. Conclusions: Although limited by its small sample size, this preliminary survey of publication professionals identified the need for improved communication of the value of RWE and more clarity in RWE terminology and publication policies.

AB: Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem with a huge social and economic burden. However, alcohol dependence is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, as it is estimated that less than 10% of people diagnosed with alcohol dependence or abuse in Europe receive any form of treatment. Among the factors that have contributed to this undertreatment is the fact that the therapeutic strategy has always been based on achieving and maintaining abstinence from alcohol, a goal often difficult to achieve. Recently it has been made available a new therapeutic approach to alcohol dependence, nalmefene, based on the reduction of alcohol consumption. In fact, nalmefene is the first drug to be approved in Europe for as‐needed use to reduce alcohol consumption in alcohol‐dependent adults with a high drinking risk level and who continue to have a high drinking risk level 2 weeks after initial assessment. Nalmefene reduces the reinforcing the effects of alcohol, helping to reduce alcohol consumption, through the modulation of the opioid system. Efficacy and tolerability of as‐needed nalmefene for the reduction of alcohol consumption was evaluated in 3 double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials conducted in Europe: two (ESENSE 1 and ESENSE 2) evaluated the efficacy of 6 months as‐needed treatment and a third (SENSE) examined the efficacy of one year as‐needed treatment with nalmefene in patients with alcohol dependence. All patients took part in a motivational and adherence‐enhancing psychosocial support (BRENDA). Post hoc subgroup analysis of ESENSE 1, ESENSE 2 and SENSE trials were conducted in patients who had at least a high drinking risk level according to WHO (> 60 g/day for men and > 40 g/day for women) at both screening and randomization (i.e. the target population). In the pooled target population of ESENSE 1 and ESENSE 2, there was a superior effect of nalmefene compared to placebo in reducing both the number of heavy drinking days (p < 0.0001) and total alcohol consumption (p < 0.0001) at the end of treatment, as well as in improving (p < 0.05) the adjusted mean change in the CGI‐S score and the adjusted mean CGI‐I score. Significantly improved (p ≤ 0.01) levels of ALT were demonstrated in patients treated with nalmefene compared to those treated with placebo in the analysis of the target population of ESENSE 1 and ESENSE 2. The reduction of GGT levels was significantly greater (p < 0.001) with nalmefene compared to placebo in the subgroup of the target population of ESENSE 1 study, but not in the ESENSE 2 study. SENSE trial gave results similar to ESENSE 1 and 2 studies. As‐needed nalmefene was generally well tolerated in patients with alcohol dependence. These studies demonstrate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of nalmefene in patients with alcohol dependence: the effect is larger in patients with at least a high drinking risk level at the start of treatment. Nalmefene has the potential to engage in treatment patients who otherwise would not have sought help, thus representing a new pharmacological treatment paradigm, in terms of treatment goal (reduction of alcohol consumption) and dosing regimen (as‐needed) in alcohol dependent patients.

AB: Background: Different treatment modalities in Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) are now available including standard rate, 1K, burst, anode intensification, 10K, Multiple Independent Current Control (MICC), etc. On the other hand, identification and analysis of clinically‐relevant patient sub‐populations using these different modalities, via mining large datasets ("Big Data") of real word evidence (RWE) and implementation of advanced analytics, have not yet been conducted. Objective: We report here the largest SCS study of its kind designed to investigate real‐world, "multimodal" SCS. Methods: This is a prospective, multi‐center, global registry study (RELIEF Registry, Boston Scientific) enrolling up to 4800 subjects at up to 150 centers. All subjects undergo a trial for pain with a commercially‐approved neurostimulator and followed up to 36‐months. To date, programming parameters and waveform usage among 800 patients have been collected. Results: Analyzed subjects used a large number of programs/waveforms from 0‐30 days postimplant (10‐11 programs) but stabilize by 6 months post‐implant (2‐3 programs). Most subjects utilized the standard SCS waveform (62.6%) compared to others (1k, anode intensification, burst). Seventy‐two percent of subjects utilized multimodal SCS versus single mode (28%). Of these, approximately 90% of subjects use at least 2 modes (~10% use 3 or more) with most using a combination of 1 kilohertz and standard rate programs (29%). Conclusion: This study collects and analyzes a large dataset of RWE. Subjects have so far been found to use multiple modalities/waveforms long‐term, using a variety of options at different times each day. This initial observation underscores the clinical‐relevance of a single device capable of multimodal SCS.

AB: Objectives: Reimbursement and patient access decisions for new medicines should be guided by relevant and good‐quality evidence. Randomised controlled trial (RCT) data are used to support these decisions, however real‐world evidence (RWE) could be considered too, especially in cases of accelerated regulatory access where RCT data is less mature, in orphan disease areas where randomised trials are difficult to conduct, or where RCTs do not reflect the patients or clinical practice outside of the trial setting. Stakeholders have different views of the acceptability of using RWE, therefore the GetReal Initiative's (www.imi‐getreal.eu) key aims are to educate and stimulate discussion on the appropriate use of RWE in medicines decision making. Results: The Initiative has developed the "RWE Navigator" (rwe‐navigator.eu) which explains key evidence challenges in relative effectiveness research and indicates potential uses for non‐randomised evidence, accompanied by overviews of data sources, study designs, quality assessment and bias adjustment of RWE. The navigator also provides links to case studies that demonstrate the potential application of RWE to support regulatory and patient access decisions. It will continue to serve as a gateway to the ongoing work of the GetReal Initiative. Conclusions: The work of the GetReal Initiative indicates that further dialogue is needed to develop policies and perspectives on RWE. The RWE Navigator has been developed to stimulate and inform the debate on the use of RWE in effectiveness research, and it has created a platform for a dialogue between industry and decision‐makers. It is a unique source of information on alternative study designs and analytical methods, informed by key decision makers' views on the acceptability and usefulness of RWE, to inform health technology assessments andpatient access decisions in Asia and elsewhere.

AB: Introduction A clean hospital environment plays a vital role in reducing healthcare associated infections. However strong evidence, using well designed studies is limited. Most studies have focussed on a single intervention or product, and have failed to take into account contextual issues that may influence feasibility and sustainability in hospital settings. Data on cost‐effectiveness is also lacking. A challenge for researchers in this area is how to maintain study validity and integrity, whilst allowing for flexibility in implementation. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of an evidencebased environmental cleaning bundle implemented in 11 different hospitals nationally, in Australia. Methods Using a randomised stepped wedge design, and an implementation science framework we systematically examined and documented existing practices and contextual factors at each trial hospital. We used this information to identify gaps and strengths in relation to the bundle components, organisational culture and readiness for change. This then informed the development of responsive implementation plans for each site. Results Improving hospital cleaning was complex. Existing cleaning practices were diverse, as were the policy, contracts, staffing and governance arrangements. Considerable effort had to be put into a developing a bespoke strategy for each site that allowed for optimal implementation, so that hospitals could transition effectively to the 'best practice' bundle. The trial design allowed researchers to stagger the intervention, and for hospitals to act as their own controls in the effectiveness analysis. Combining this with high quality economic analysis will allow us to evaluate value for money in different scenarios. Conclusion We need better quality research in infection prevention, moving beyond effectiveness to also consider context, feasibility, sustainability and cost. Pragmatic trials combining the best of epidemiology, implementation science and economic methods are an innovative approach, providing a unique insight into what works, how it works, and how much it costs, in a variety of real world settings.

AB: Background and Aims: Different treatment modalities in Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) are now available including standard rate, 1 K, burst, anode intensification, 10 K, Multiple Independent Current Control (MICC), etc. On the other hand, identification and analysis of clinically‐relevant patient subpopulations using these different modalities, via mining large datasets of real word evidence (RWE) and implementation of advanced analytics, have not yet been conducted. We report here the largest SCS study of its kind designed to investigate real‐world, multimodal SCS. Methods: This is a prospective, multi‐center, global registry study (RELIEF Registry, Boston Scientific) enrolling up to 4800 subjects at up to 150 centers. All subjects undergo a trial for pain with a commercially‐approved neurostimulator and followed up to 36‐months. Previously collected utilization data from800 patients using a system capable of multiple programs/waveforms was collected. Results: Analyzed subjects used several programs/waveforms from 0‐30 days post‐implant (10‐11 programs) but stabilize by 6 months post‐implant (2‐3 programs). Most subjects utilized the standard SCS waveform (62.6%) compared to others (1 k, anode intensification, burst). Seventy‐two percent of subjects utilized multimodal SCS versus single mode (28%). Of these, approximately 90% of subjects use at least 2 modes (~10% use 3 or more) with most using a combination of 1 kilohertz and standard rate programs (29%). Conclusions: This study collects and analyzes a large dataset of RWE. Subjects have so far been found to use multiple modalities/waveforms long‐term, using a variety of options at different times each day. This initial observation underscores the clinical‐relevance of a single device capable of multimodal SCS.

AB: The term "Real‐world evidence" in Multiple Sclerosis encompasses a wide variety of different data collection methodologies. Registries can provide structured, prospectively collected real‐word evidence for analysis of treatment efficacy, treatment sequencing outcomes and serious adverse event identity and frequency. The information from multiple centres is collected prospectively using a minimum agreed dataset and observation frequency. The major barrier to participation is cost and time. Therefore, data collection systems ideally should provide resources and other value‐adds to clinicians in return for this considerable burden. The globally operative MSBase is a very successful collaborative, prospective Multiple Sclerosis registry. It has attracted over 35,000 patient records at more than 200 MS centres, and its median recorded visit density is, at 5.5 months, better than most sponsored Phase IV studies. Registry analysts have provided validation of registry‐based comparative treatment outcomes analyses by replicating several Phase 3 trial results using propensity matching procedures in lieu of randomization. Recent publications from the MSBase registry have demonstrated the superiority of either natalizumab or fingolimod over interferonbeta or glatiramer as a switching choice after on ‐treatment relapse, and further demonstrated the relative superiority of natalizumab over fingolimod in the same scenario. Long‐term outcome modeling using the same registry dataset is evolving, but several analyses have no conclusively demonstrated the beneficial effect of diseasemodifying drug treatment in reducing disability accumulation in relapsing‐remitting MS.

AB: A recent phase III clinical trial has demonstrated that the treatment with the somatostatin analogue pasireotide normalizes cortisol secretion in 1528% of patients with Cushing's disease (CD). The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 6‐months pasireotide treatment on clinical and hormonal profiles in a group of CD patients with mild to moderate disease according with the realword evidence. Thirty‐two patients with CD unsuccessfully treated by surgery and with persistently increased urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels started pasireotide treatment at the dose of 600 mg bid. UFC, plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels were measured every three months together with clinical and metabolic parameters. Five patients discontinued treatment during the first 6 months for adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal disturbances? among the remaining 27 patients, 14 with very mild, 6 with mild, 6 with moderate and 1 with very severe UFC increase reached 6‐months follow‐up? the study focused on the 26 patients with very mild to moderate disease. After 6‐months pasireotide treatment, UFC levels were normalized (ULN<1) or nearly normalized (ULN between 1 and 1.1) in 22 out of 32 (68.7%) patients. A significant decrease of UFC (p=0.004), serum cortisol (p=0.011) and ACTH levels (p=0.002) were demonstrated in the entire cohort of CD patients. The decrease of UFC levels was accompanied by a significant decrease in weight (p=0.000), body mass index (p=0.000), waist circumference (p=0.01) as well as serum total cholesterol (0.023) and LDL cholesterol levels (p=0.011). Fasting plasma glucose (p=0.003) and glycosylated haemoglobin (p=0.000) levels increased significantly. Hyperglycaemia or deterioration of diabetes was documented in 67% whereas gastrointestinal disturbances, mainly diarrhoea, were documented in 31% of patients. Among the 18 patients with available pituitary MRI at baseline and at 6 months of follow‐up, tumour remained stable in 13 patients and decreased in 4 patients? in particular, 1 macroadenoma became a microadenoma, 2 microadenoma became invisible. A slight enlargement was found in one macroadenoma. In conclusion, pasireotide treatment induces normalization of UFC in nearly 70% of patients with very mild to moderate CD during clinical practice, with consequent improvement in the clinical picture, but with occurrence or deterioration of diabetes or gastrointestinal disturbances in 3167% of cases. These results confirmed the usefulness of pasireotide in controlling CD especially in patients with non severe disease.

AB: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have become ubiquitous in every field of medicine today but there has been limited success in implementation and improvement in health outcomes. Guidelines are largely based on the results of traditional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which adopt a highly selective process to maximise the intervention's chance of demonstrating efficacy thus having high internal validity but lacking external validity. Therefore, guidelines based on these RCTs often suffer from a gap between trial efficacy and real world effectiveness and is one of the common reasons contributing to poor guideline adherence by physicians. "Real World Evidence" (RWE) can complement RCTs in CPG development. RWE‐in the form of data from integrated electronic health records‐represents the vast and varied collective experience of frontline doctors and patients. RWE has the potential to fill the gap in current guidelines by balancing information about whether a test or treatment works (efficacy) with data on how it works in real world practice (effectiveness). RWE can also advance the agenda of precision medicine in everyday practice by engaging frontline stakeholders in pragmatic biomarker studies. This will enable guideline developers to more precisely determine not only whether a clinical test or treatment is recommended, but for whom and when. Singapore is well positioned to ride the big data and RWE wave as we have the advantages of high digital interconnectivity, an integrated National Electronic Health Record (NEHR), and governmental support in the form of the Smart Nation initiative.

DOI: 10.1007/s12325-017-0490-2
AB: Introduction: The guidelines recommend a beta‐blocker or calcium channel blocker as the first‐line medication for angina, supplemented by other agents for additional symptoms. One such agent is trimetazidine (TMZ), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of anginal episodes and improve exercise performance without affecting haemodynamic parameters. However, extensive real‐world evidence for its efficacy in combination with first‐line therapies has been lacking. Methods: The aim of this large‐scale, Russian, multicentre, 6‐month, open‐label, prospective observational study was to assess the effect of adding TMZ modified release 35 mg bid to background antianginal therapy in the real‐world clinical setting. Results: The study included 896 patients: 54% women, aged 29‐90 years (42.6% >65 years), 63% with class II angina, and receiving beta‐blockers alone or in combination (93%). Add‐on TMZ reduced angina frequency and short‐acting nitrate use within 2 weeks (both p < 0.0001) regardless of background therapy and maintained this effect over 6 months. It increased the proportion of patients with class I angina sixfold while decreasing that of class 3 angina almost fourfold. It also improved walking distance and well‐being at 6 months (both p < 0.0001). Treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion: Add‐on TMZ is a safe and rapidly effective treatment for reducing angina attacks and nitrate use in the real‐world clinical setting. It also increases exercise capacity and well‐being. These effects are observed within 2 weeks and persist for at least 6 months. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)

AB: Objectives: The IMI‐GetReal project aimed to explore incorporation of robust methods for real‐world evidence (RWE) collection and synthesis in the medicines development process, both by pharmaceutical companies and healthcare decision makers. The focus was on the potential use of RWE, alone or in combination with randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to demonstrate effectiveness of new interventions. Seven case studies were conducted in multiple disease areas to examine methods for predicting drug effectiveness and the perspectives of different stakeholders on these methods. This study aimed to identify practical obstacles in accessing and using RWE and RCT data for effectiveness research conducted as part of these case studies. Methods: Qualitative content analysis was conducted to identify and characterize key issues relating to accessing and analyzing study data from external sources, both RWE & RCTs. Results: Accessing RWE from registries proved difficult due to multiple reasons, including: complex and non‐transparent application procedures, resistance from registry owners to discuss applications and datasets not being research‐ready within project timeframes. There were also issues with RWE eventually accessed, including a lack of individual participant data (IPD) and incomplete data. Where access to IPD from RCTs was obtainable, there were restrictions imposed on how it could be used. For example, it could not be used to target analysis on an individual product, but rather explore methodologies for data synthesis in a product‐anonymized setting. This condition encouraged additional data sharing by other stakeholders. Conclusions: Despite the collaborative, multi‐stakeholder nature of IMI‐GetReal and proper disclosures with data owners, access to data proved challenging. Such barriers to data accessibility can delay effectiveness research, restrict opportunities for the development of methods incorporating RWE and diminish the potential use of RWE in decision‐making. Where data is intended to be used for this purpose, sufficient attention should be paid to these potential barriers.

AB: Real‐world evidence is derived from Real‐world data (RWD), and can inform drug/device development, research on outcomes and health care systems, safety surveillance, well‐controlled effectiveness studies, and patient care, in the nervous system. Clinical Innovation Network (CIN) is new a concept supported by Ministry of Health, Labour andWelfare Japan to improve the environment of the clinical development that enables efficient clinical trial by utilizing patient registry that is a primary key source of RWD. Usefulness of patient registry in clinical trial/ research in the clinical development can be broadly outlined as follows; market research, survey on the feasibility of clinical trial, creation of protocol, recruiting patients to clinical trial, establishing control group in non randomized control study, postmarketing survey and safetymeasures. In doing this, it is required to establish a network of the related institutions and to form the clinical study consortium in cooperation with the industry and academia,as wellas regulatoryagency.Thefollowingissueswere considered as commonproblems regardless of the individual disease area. 1) Gathering information about existing patient registries, analysis and listing in the form that is easy to use for pharmaceutical companies and others, 2) Ethical issues and how to handle personal information, 3) Standardization of registry items and information technology system, 4) How to use and apply patients' registry data to clinical trial/clinical research. In addition, infrastructure of the central support in order to promote CIN and the function of “One‐Stop” is demanded by pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, new registries are required based on the regulatory complaint for natural history as control groups in clinical trial and the source of post‐marketing survey to provide efficacy and safety measures as RWD.

AB: Introduction: The aim of the present study was to use real‐world data from Swedish primary‐care and national registries to understand clinical outcomes in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with liraglutide in clinical practice, and to compare with data from those treated with sitagliptin. Methods: This was a non‐interventional, retrospective study conducted between February 2014 and September 2014 using T2D patient data from Swedish primary‐care centers and national healthcare registries. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of liraglutide in control of glycemia and body weight in clinical practice (stage 1). The secondary objective was to compare the clinical effectiveness of liraglutide with sitagliptin on glycemic control and body weight in clinical practice in a propensity‐score‐matched population (stage 2). Results: In stage 1 (n = 402), 39.4% of patients treated with liraglutide achieved >1.0% (10.9 mmol/mol) reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 180 days of treatment and 54.9% achieved the target HbA1c of <7.0% (53.0 mmol/mol). Moreover, compared with baseline, 22.5% of patients treated with liraglutide achieved both >1.0% reduction in HbA1c and >3.0% reduction in body weight. In stage 2, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving liraglutide (n = 180) than sitagliptin (n = 208) achieved >1.0% reduction in HbA1c [52.9% vs 33.5%, respectively (P = 0.0002)]. Mean body‐weight loss was also significantly greater in patients receiving liraglutide vs sitagliptin [‐3.5 vs ‐1.3 kg, respectively (P < 0.0001)]. Conclusion: This study provides real‐world evidence from Sweden corroborating previous clinical trials that demonstrate greater efficacy of liraglutide over sitagliptin on glycemic control and body‐weight reduction in patients with T2D.

AB: Objective: Publication professionals are often responsible for dissemination of data from various sources. Often under‐estimated, disease registries are a source of real‐world data and can serve as an important component of an integrated publication plan. The Connect MM registry is the largest non‐interventional, US‐based prospective, observational cohort study of patients with newlydiagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM). Its objective is to investigate MM diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in routine clinical practice in a mostly community setting. This abstract describes how data from the Connect MM registry has contributed to a publication plan and has informed clinical practice. Methods: Connect MM (NCT01081028) was initiated in September 2009, enrolling 3011 patients from 250 academic‐, government‐, and community‐based centers. Patients were ≥18 years of age with an MM diagnosis within 2 months of enrollment. Governance is through a scientific steering committee. This analysis evaluated the utility and topics of registry publications. Results: Registry publications included eight peer‐reviewed manuscripts, 41 abstracts with four oral presentations, and 36 posters. Findings include: identification of gaps between diagnostic guidelines and clinical practice; the ineligibility of patients for inclusion in randomized trials; visualization of the changing NDMM treatment landscape; and confirmation of the benefits of maintenance therapy observed in clinical trials. Limitations are the registry's non‐randomized design, treatment and assessment based on investigator decisions, and missing data. However, a strength of the registry is the ability to query sites for more information on questionable data. Conclusions: The robust output from Connect MM demonstrates the utility of registries as an integral real‐world evidence component of a publication plan. Registry publications have contributed to the overall understanding of NDMM diagnosis, treatment patterns, and outcomes in clinical practice.

AB: Objectives: The effectiveness of intravitreal anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) agents is usually lower in real‐world settings compared to randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Identifying matching cohorts might bridge the gap in clinical outcomes, but there is uncertainty about which factors to include in the matching process. This study aimed to identify potential confounders that explain the difference in readouts between non‐interventional studies (NIS) and RCTs in nAMD patients using an algorithm based on ranibizumab real‐world data (RWD), in reference to the CATT study1 results. Methods: A step‐wise, predictive analytics approach was applied to develop a decision model where the terminal nodes represented the most influential factors on visual acuity (VA) at the end of year 1. The decision tree used electronic medical records (EMR) data from the USA. The algorithm was validated using EMR data from UK and Australia. Results: The algorithm identified the following criteria as impactful on readouts: 1) Age>50 years, 2) Baseline VA<73 ETDRS letters, 3) presence of sub‐retinal fluid and 4) administration of 3 loading doses by day‐90 from drug initiation. When applying criterion 1, patients showed an increase in VA of 0.07. Application of criterion 2 increased VA by 1.08. Similarly, when criteria 3&4 were applied in addition to 1&2, VA increased by 3.22 and 5.25, respectively. VA results after applying the complete algorithm were comparable to those of the CATT trial which demonstrated a 6 letter gain. Conclusions: In nAMD, core attributes that matched NIS with RCT outcomes were age, baseline VA, sub‐retinal fluid and loading‐dose as label recommended. Our investigation demonstrates that RWD can generate clinical efficacy (VA) comparable to RCTs. These results highlight the impact of under‐treatment and loading‐dose on VA and build confidence in real‐world evidence and its ability to support meaningful dialogue with ophthalmologists and retina specialists. 1Ophthalmology. 2016;123(8):1751‐1761.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Bayesian network meta‐analysis (NMA) has become standard practice in evidence synthesis. NMAs typically only include randomized clinical trials (RCT) based on the hierarchy of evidence. Real world evidence (RWE) is increasingly used in health economics and outcomes research. The objective of this research was to review methods combining different levels of evidence and to compare their benefits and drawbacks. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify methodological papers and published NMAs combining different study designs. Searches were conducted in PubMed and Embase. Extensive hand searches were also conducted and consisted of reviewing citations found in included publications and searching conference proceedings, health technology agencies' websites, and methodological guidelines. RESULTS: Four main methods for combining evidence from different study designs were identified: naive pooling of all types of evidence, conducting a design‐adjusted analysis, using non‐randomized evidence as prior information, and running a three level hierarchical model. These methods were associated with advantages such as optimizing precision and network connection through the inclusion of more evidence, modelling bias directly by accounting for between‐study type variability, understanding the bias non‐randomized data may introduce into the analysis, and generating more generalizable NMA outputs. These methods were also associated with the following drawbacks: introduction of bias by including non‐randomized trials, challenges associated with evaluating the bias associated with RWE studies. CONCLUSIONS: Given the lack of published guidance in this research area, the methods reviewed are considered exploratory and their perception by health technology assessment agencies is uncertain. While the three level hierarchical modelling approach seems to best allow for bias adjustment, further research remains to be conducted to address the bias inherent to pooling data from different sources. Refining these methods would help develop tools for a more generalizable comparative effectiveness assessment of health technologies.

AB: Objectives: Education and product training are critical but overlooked variables in the value assessment of medical devices. Over 24 million insulin injections occur daily in Europe.1 Many of these injections occur into undiagnosed Lipohypertrophy (LH). Insulin absorption is significantly reduced when injecting into LH. Using Real World Evidence we aimed to determine whether significant cost savings associated with proper device selection, regimen adherence and outcomes would lower healthcare system costs. Methods: Using Real World Evidence generated from 18 CCG centres across the UK in an England/Scotland Lipohypertrohy Audit (ESLA) we developed a robust patient and HCP questionnaire that aimed to quantify the important role proper injection technique has in achieving and maintaining optimal glycemic control. A prospective, 3 visit audit study was conducted composed of 3 distinct phases: Study nurse training, patient recruitment, and finish study (patient exit). The primary endpoint was reduction in insulin usage. The secondary endpoint was reduction in HbA1c. These were comparted to baseline as well as modelled against a 13,000+ Injection Technique questionnaire to determine healthcare system savings and cost reductions. Results: The ESLA audits yielded an n of 75, and the ITQ yielded an n of 13,289. The results were comparable across both sample sizes. The prevalence of Lipohypertrophy was 50% on entry to the audit, and was reduced to 33% on exit. Mean insulin reduction related to ESLA ranged from 2 units per person per day to 17 units per person per day. Conclusions: Medical device value is materially impacted by the level of additional training and HCP support. The higher the training, the more aligned efficacy and effectiveness data become. This makes intuitive sense, as practice replicates the idea setting of a controlled trial. It is therefore highly recommended that additional training and HCP support be a key variable in the value assessment of medical devices.

AB: Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may not always reflect realworld outcomes of medicines. In comparison, real‐world evidence (RWE) mimic settings wherein patients with comorbidities, polypharmacy and possibly different compliance levels are exposed to a medicine, thereby assessing its therapeutic benefits in daily clinical practice, thus enhancing and complementing data from RCTs. Purpose: In this post‐hoc analysis, we compared blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of amlodipine/valsartan (Aml/Val) combination therapy in RCTs and RWE studies conducted in patients with hypertension. Methods: Data from 23 studies, with 4650 patients from RCTs and 1817 patients from RWE studies, were pooled and analyzed. In these studies, patients with uncontrolled hypertension (>140/90 mmHg) were assigned to either Aml/Val at different doses (5/80, 5/160 or 10/160 mg) or placebo. Only patients without missing data were included. Using a fitted linear mixed‐effects model and random factors, interaction of treatment and study design on mean sitting (MS) systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP) reductions from baseline to 3 months of treatment were compared. For studies with duration >3 months, data were analyzed for the initial 3‐month period. In studies with a cross‐over design and/or titration, only the initial study period was analyzed (min: 60; max: 90 days of observation). Results: Patients' baseline and demographic characteristics were comparable between RCT and RWE datasets and within Aml/Val treatment groups (Ta‐ ble). In both RCT and RWE settings, least‐squares mean (LSM) reductions in MSSBP/MSDBP and MSPP from baseline were significant (p<0.05) across all dosages. Efficacy of Aml/Val in RCTs was not significantly different from its effectiveness in RWE studies (Figure). Conclusion: This post‐hoc analysis confirms the effectiveness of Aml/Val (5/80, 5/160 and 10/160 mg) in a real‐world environment in Germany and in different countries in the Middle East and Asia. Furthermore, these results proved to be very similar to the clinical efficacy of Aml/Val in RCTs. (Figure Presented).

AB: Background: Patient (Pt) reported outcomes (PROs) play a role in overall disease evaluation, therapeutic response assessment and care of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (Pts). The Pt Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS [P]) questionnaires developed by the NIH have been validated and are a feasible assessment tool in RA (Bartlett 2015). Objectives: AWARE (Comparative and Pragmatic Study of Golimumab Intravenous (IV) Versus Infliximab in RA) is a real‐world study of golimumab IV (G‐IV) vs. infliximab (IFX) in RA and will assess infusion reactions, disease activity and multiple PROs as outcomes measures. Methods: AWARE is a prospective, noninterventional, ongoing US‐based study in which 1,200 adult Pts will be enrolled on initiation of treatment with G‐IV or IFX. Objectives include PRO assessments of Pt response to treatment using the PROMIS‐29 Profile v2.0 (P29v2), P Pain Interference Short Form‐6b (PISF) and P Fatigue Short Form‐7a (FSF), 36‐Item Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36v2) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI). We report an interim analysis from the first 353 Pts of baseline PROMIS questionnaire and CDAI scores, and their inter‐relationships. PROMIS questionnaire results are scored on a 0 to 100 scale, normed to the US population and reported as a "T‐score" (mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10). PROMIS T scores were compared across CDAI disease activity (DA) categories. Results: Baseline mean (SD) CDAI score was 33.46 (+/‐15.79), with 73.4% of pts with high DA (HDA), 22.1% with moderate disease activity (MDA), 3.7% with low disease activity (LDA) and 0.8% pts in remission. PROMIS scores are shown below. All P29v2 domains, PISF and FSF scores were significantly worse in pts with CDAI>22 vs. CDAI<=22 (p<0.05). The same was true for SF‐36 domains (data not shown). PROMIS scores are shown below for all pts, and also based on CDAI DA category. PROMIS T scores across all domains (P29v2 domains, PISF and FSF) were compared to CDAI disease activity category (below). As shown, PROMIS T scores correlated with CDAI disease category, with HDA Pt T scores significantly (*, p<0.05) greater than those of MDA, LDA and Remission pts (excepting the Sleep Disturbance domain). Conclusions: These interim data further support the viability of using PROMIS questionnaires to evaluate RA pts, and indicate in this predominantly HDA population of RA pts correlations between PROMIS and CDAI disease activity category. Confirmation of the baseline interim analysis findings with the fully enrolled AWARE study, as well as inclusion of longitudinal and subset analyses based on disease activity levels, will further define the role of PROMIS relative to CDAI in RA patients in a real world setting.

DOI: 10.1177/1352458517750967
AB: Background: Despite recent reports of positive outcomes in clinical trials, a significant unmet need exists in the treatment of patients with progressive forms of MS. The TEMSO (NCT00134563) and TOWER (NCT00751881) trials of terifluno‐mide in patients with relapsing forms of MS (RMS) included a small proportion of patients (n=122; 5.4%) classified at the time as having secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or progressive relapsing MS (PRMS). Post hoc analysis of data from these patients with progressive forms of RMS demonstrated that treatment with high‐dose teriflunomide (14 mg) could be associated with long‐term stabilization of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Experience of the use of teriflunomide in this patient population from real‐world clinical practice complements evidence obtained from randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical studies. Objectives: To present updated long‐term disability data, as measured by EDSS, in patients with progressive forms of RMS treated with teriflunomide in the real‐world setting. Methods: Clinical and MRI outcomes were collected retrospec‐tively for 20 patients with progressive forms of RMS treated with teriflunomide in 2 large MS centers in the USA. Results: Nineteen of the 20 patients had a diagnosis of SPMS; the 1 remaining patient had PRMS. The mean age was 57 years and 75% of the patients were female. Disease duration since initial diagnosis of MS ranged from 7 to 37 years. Patients were treated with teriflunomide for 3 to 5 years; 1 patient received terifluno‐mide 7 mg, the remainder with the 14‐mg dose. All patients had received prior disease‐modifying therapy (DMT), the majority with an injectable DMT (interferon, glatiramer acetate). EDSS scores at the last visit ranged from 2 to 7.5. In 17 (85%) patients, EDSS scores remained stable vs their score at initiation of teriflu‐nomide. Scores for 3 patients worsened (6.0 to 6.5; 6.5 to 7.0; 6.5 to 7.5); in these cases, disability worsening corresponded with worsening based on MRI. Two of the patients who had an increased EDSS score had interrupted teriflunomide treatment. Conclusion: These real‐world observational outcomes provide supportive evidence that treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg is associated with long‐term stable disability in patients with pro‐gressive forms of RMS. These results are in accordance with those from the teriflunomide clinical trial program Clinical Trials.

DOI: 10.1007/s10840-017-0231-0
AB: Background: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are an essential first step for testing the safety and efficacy of a drug, but it is important to complement RCTs with real‐world evidence (RWE) of drug performance in routine clinical practice. RWE is a broad term, so it is important to determine the level of awareness and understanding amongst relevant stakeholders. Methods: Online surveys were completed by healthcare pro‐fessionals (HCPs) and payers across seven countries (France, Germany, UK, China, Japan, Brazil and Mexico). Surveys comprised 14 questions related to RWE and were completed by 100 general practitioners, 100 cardiologists, 100 nurses and 50 payers per country between August and October 2016. Results: The majority of HCPs and payers said they understood the meaning of RWE in relation to healthcare. HCPs (46.2%) and payers (48.3%) thought the greatest value of RWE was in complementing RCTs, and 45.7% of HCPs and 46.9% of payers thought it also valuable for health technology assessments. Over half of payers (52.1%) reported using RWE to compare treatment effectiveness, with cardiovascular the top therapy area where RWE is used to assist their decision‐making. The most common reason (49.8%) for using RWE by HCPs was to increase understanding of medicine effective‐ness and the benefit‐risk profile in the real‐world setting. The majority of HCPs (86.5%) and payers (87.1%) were interested in keeping abreast of recently published RWE, and medical journals were the preferred channel (54.6 and 58.2%). Most payers (57.7%) did not believe RWE helps increase understanding of how a medicine works in practice, but 72.0% thought it provides useful benefit‐risk safety and treatment data. Among HCPs, antidiabetic medicines (55.2%) were seen as the most challenging for patient adherence/persistence. Food interactions, multiple dose regimens and poor understanding of the risks of non‐compliance were cited by HCPs as the top 3 barriers to adherence/persistence, and over half of HCPs believed this could be supported by patient discussion and regular follow‐up appointments. The majority of HCPs (75.4%) and payers (81.7%) believe their use of RWE will increase in the future, with mobile health and wearable technology being sources of RWE that HCPs (30.1%) and payers (24.6%) would use in the future. Conclusion: There is a good general awareness and understanding of the value of RWE by relevant stakeholders, and this appreciation is likely to increase further in the future.

AB: Objectives: Network Meta‐Analysis (NMA) is becoming a key component of submissions to reimbursement agencies world‐wide, especially when there is limited head‐to‐head evidence for multiple technologies. However, almost all NMAs only consider Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) even though there may be considerable Real World Evidence (RWE) available ‐ for example observational studies or registry‐based studies. Evaluation of methods to enable the inclusion of RWE, especially in the light of the changing nature of RCTs from both a regulatory and reimbursement perspective, is considered here. Methods: RCTs and RWE studies were searched for using standard filters and databases up to, and including, the regulatory approval of Fingolimod by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2011 for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). A number of NMAs were then conducted and which included; only RCTs, both RCTs and RWE (accepted at face‐value), both RCTs and RWE but including an additional level in the NMA hierarchical model to represent the different study designs, and finally both RCTs and RWE but adjusting the RWE for potential biases. Results: Identification of RWE in addition to RCTs in this MS example significantly increased the number of studies (and comparisons) that were potentially included in the NMA. Whilst the inclusion of the additional RWE led to a reduction in the level of uncertainty surrounding most effect estimates, this depended on the method of inclusion adopted for the RWE, and the extent to which biases were adjusted for. Conclusions: This initial evaluation of methods for the inclusion of RWE in NMAs indicates that methods of adjustment for the potential biases in RWE can have a significant impact on the level of uncertainty. Consequently further work investigating both empirical evidence for such biases and methods of elicitation from experts on the extent of biases associated with individual RWE studies is warranted.

AB: AIMS: To assess clinical characteristics, and factors associated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients initiating GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study in patients with T2DM who initiated GLP‐1RAs between 2007 and 2014 in primary health care centers in Catalonia (Spain). We evaluated changes in HbA1c and body weight at 6‐12 months, and factors independently associated with achieving ≥1% HbA1c target reduction. RESULTS: Overall, 4242 patients (47.9% male; mean BMI 37.5 kg/m2) initiated a GLP‐1RA. At 6‐12 months, the mean HbA1c level decreased from the baseline 8.8% to 7.7% (‐1.0%; SD =1.6). A 1% reduction in HbA1c was observed in 47.2% of patients. Patients lost a mean of 3.6 kg (SD =6.2). Sixty percent of patients reduced both HbA1c and body weight, and 17% achieved only one of these targets. Independent determinants of a 1% HbA1c reduction were baseline HbA1c, age, diabetes duration, and being on insulin treatment. Reduction in weight or HbA1c and the proportion of patients achieving a HbA1c reduction of ≥1% was significantly larger among subjects prescribed liraglutide than exenatide and lixisenatide. CONCLUSIONS: In this real‐world, retrospective study, the magnitude of HbA1c and body weight reductions after addition of a GLP‐1RA were similar to those observed in randomized controlled trials. Approximately sixty percent of patients attained reductions in both HbA1c and body weight, and there were significant differences among different drugs from this therapeutic group.

AB: Background and Aims: Rifaximin‐a is indicated in Europe for prevention of recurrent episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients ≥18 years old. Its efficacy was confirmed in a randomized controlled trial (Bass et al. NEJM 2010); rifaximin 550mg b.i.d. reduced the relative risk of recurrence of HE and hospitalisation by 58% and 50%, respectively (absolute risk reduction 24% and 9%, respectively). To translate this 'efficacy' into 'effectiveness', real world data are needed. The aim of this study is to monitor the clinical effectiveness of rifaximin‐α and its impact on health care resources in Europe and Australia. Methods: This is an observational, multicentre study with 550 patients. Inclusion criteria: adults with a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and one confirmed HE event within the past 12 months, which can include the index event. Exclusion criteria: prior treatment with rifaximin‐α, contraindications to the use of rifaximin‐α, hepatocellular carcinoma, inability to give informed consent or West Haven score of ≥2 at the point of study entry. Timing of recruitment: patients can enter into this study from the point of hospital discharge up to 8 weeks after hospital discharge. Study Design: patients will be followed up prospectively for 24‐months. Patients will either be managed with rifaximin‐α (treatment group) or not managed with rifaximin‐α (control group) in the prospective phase. The treating physician will decide the allocation of treatment according to local practice. The study will also have a retrospective part, in which clinical information from medical records for the prior 12 months will be obtained. Primary endpoint: the number and duration of hospitalisation. Secondary endpoints will include mortality rate, incidence of other cirrhosis complications, 30‐day readmission rate, accident and emergency visits, primary care contacts and quality of life. Results: Initial analyses will be performed after 12 months of data collection. Full dataset should be available for analysis by July 2018. Conclusions: Currently, there are little data on the 'effectiveness' of secondary prophylaxis and the impact on health care resource used in Europe and Australia with rifaximin‐α. Therefore, the findings of this study may provide important real world evidence. Furthermore, the data could potentially provide a better understanding of the burden and natural history of HE, and variability in disease management in individual units.

AB: Background: Rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in stroke or systemic embolism prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fbrillation (NVAF) in the ROCKET AF randomized controlled trial. Real‐world evidence from XANTUS in an unselected rivaroxaban‐treated NVAF population also showed low rates of stroke and major bleeding. However, because ROCKET AF did not include patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1, XANTUS results refect a broader patient population. Therefore, safety and effcacy outcomes in XANTUS patients with a similar baseline risk were compared to those in ROCKET AF to assess concordance between clinical trial and real‐world data. Methods: Aggregated outcomes from 7,061 patients receiving rivaroxaban in ROCKET AF were compared with respective adjusted outcomes from 4,020 rivaroxaban‐treated patients in XANTUS who were re‐weighted to adjust for CHADS2 score (categories 2, 3 and 4‐6) and gender differences. Weights were determined using the matching‐adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) method. This resulted in an estimated effective sample size of 2,492 XANTUS patients. Results: Adjusted annualized incidence rates are presented for XANTUS and contrasted with those in ROCKET AF. Adjusted incidence rate of any treatment‐emergent adjudicated major bleeding in XANTUS was similar to incidence rate in ROCKET AF (3.10% and 3.60%, respectively; MAIC rate ratio 0.86; 95% confdence interval [CI] 0.67‐1.12). Rates of stroke or non‐central nervous system embolism were also similar in XANTUS (adjusted rates) and ROCKET AF (1.54% vs 1.70%, respectively; MAIC rate ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.62‐1.32), as were myocardial infarction rates (adjusted rates for XANTUS) (0.75% vs 0.91%, respectively; MAIC rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.49‐1.39). However, adjusted all‐cause mortality rate was higher in XANTUS than the rate in ROCKET AF (3.22% vs 1.87%, respectively; MAIC rate ratio 1.72; 95% CI 1.31‐2.27), as could be expected in a real‐life study that included patients with underlying conditions. Conclusions: The low rates of major bleeding and stroke in the rivaroxaban‐treated XANTUS population are generally consistent with results from ROCKET AF.

AB: Objectives: There are many circumstances under which networks of evidence may be 'disconnected' and network meta‐analysis (NMA) cannot be conducted, unless additional assumptions are made. However, real‐world evidence (RWE) which is becoming a more widely used source of clinical data to complement randomised evidence for relative effectiveness assessment, could help inform missing 'connections' within a network. We consider the impact of RWE on NMA to compare existing biologic DMARDS in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for second‐line therapy in a disconnected network. Methods: A literature search was undertaken to identify RCTs evaluating second‐line biological therapies in RA. Patient data from two European registries were also accessed. Standard Bayesian NMA and naïve pooling of standard of care were applied and evaluated. Alternatively, RWE and RCT data were combined in an NMA to connect the RA network of studies. Results: Only 4 RCTs were identified for second‐line biologics with one treatment (Golimumab) disconnected from the network. All methods applied were effective in allowing for the comparison of Golimumab against all other treatments. For example, Golimumab had increased probability of achieving remission by 7.6% (CI: 2.3% to 13.6%) compared to standard of care, an estimate that would not have been possible to obtain if using RCT data alone. The addition of RWE to the RCT data led to a decrease in the level of uncertainty of the probability of remission in Rituximab compared to standard of care from 8.3% (CI: 4.9% to 12%) to 7.2% (CI: 4.1% to 10.7%). Conclusions: The use of RWE was a useful approach here. By bridging disconnected networks of RCT evidence, RWE allowed evaluation of treatment options otherwise not comparable via a standard NMA of RCTs alone. In addition, estimates of effect of treatments already included in the RCT network were obtained with higher precision when including the RWE.

AB: Background/Purpose: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)in a musculoskeletal inflammatory condition associated with psoriasis. It has a heterogeneous set of clinical manifestations which include peripheral arthritis, axial involvement, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin, and nail disease. In current practice, the treatment of PsA involves initiating a conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD), usually followed by an initial Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitor (TNFi) and then a second TNFi before considering other classes of biological DMARD (bDMARD). The efficacy of TNFi in patients with PsA is documented in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for several of these agents, including etanercept (ETA), infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab, compared with placebo. However, little is known about the utility of combining a TNFi with MTX (C) versus TNFi monotherapy (M)in psoriatic arthritis and studies to this day show conflicting results. We evaluate here the comparative sustainability of ETA used in first or second intention in patients with PsA initially treated in C or M. Methods: Data from all RHUMADATA® patients with PsA prescribed ETA either as an initial or second TNFi was analyzed. Patients were followed until treatment discontinuation, loss to follow‐up or February 21st, 2018. Only patients who were treated for at least six months were included. The characteristics of selected patients were tabulated, and the ETA discontinuation rates of patients who initiated C and M were compared using Kaplan‐Meier estimates and multivariate Cox models adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 195 patients with PsA(according to CASPAR criteria) received ETA in first or second intention. Of those, 102(52.3%) and 93(47.7%) received treatment without and with MTX respectively. There were statistically significant differences in populations in table 1 for the BASDAI (M: 5.8±2.8; C: 3.9±2.3; p=0.03) and BASFI (M:5.0±3.0; C: 2.8±2.0; p=0.011) scores, both being higher in the M group. No significant differences in retention rates between M and C therapy were observed (see figure below). Mean retention time for M and C therapy were respectively 7.12(SE=0.42) and 8.25(SE=0.68) years. The main reason for treatment cessation was inefficacy, followed by adverse events. There were more adverse events in the C group (26.1% vs 9.3%). Sub‐analysis looking at ETA in first and in second intention showed similar results. Conclusion: Combining MTX to ETA does not improve sustainability in patients with PsA. (Figure Presented).

AB: Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of lidocaine and dexmedetomidine in preventing propofolinduced pain in routine clinical practice. Materials and methods: In this single center, prospective, non‐interventional observational study, the women of ASA grade I or II with age between 18 to 65 years who were scheduled to undergo elective gynaecologic surgery under general anaesthesia with the use of propofol during 2010‐2015 were enrolled. Patients received dexmedetomidine (0.2 mcg/kg, intravenously) and lidocaine (0.2 mg/kg, intravenously) at least 30 minutes prior to propofol injection (2 mg/kg) for induction during general anaesthesia. Pain after propofol injection was assessed from each patient after pre‐treatment of lidocaine and dexmedetomidine using McCrirrick and Hunter scale for pain evaluation. Results: A total of 1560 patients (778 patients in lidocaine groups and 782 patients in dexmedetomidine groups) were analysed. Both dexmedetomidine and lidocaine significantly decreased pain after administration of propofol in Chinese patents undergoing elective surgery. Significant reduction in pain score was found higher among patients who received lidocaine as compared to dexmedetomidine (p<0.05). Moreover, onset of analgesia after lidocaine injection was significantly shorter when compared dexmedetomidine among patients who received propofol (p=0.04). Approximately 65% of patients treated with lidocaine had no pain after propofol injection; this was significantly higher when compared with dexmedetomidine (p<0.05). Conclusion: We suggest lidocaine is superior to dexmedetomidine in reducing propofol induced pain. Pre‐treatment with intravenous injection of lidocaine was found better alternative to dexmedetomidine injection in management of propofol induced pain. Both the treatment is having acceptable safety profile. Copyright © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.

AB: Objectives: Real world evidence (RWE) pose additional methodological challenges for evaluating causality, including confounding, missing/misclassified data, no clear treatment assignment, dynamic treatment regimens, and switching. We aimed to assess the type and impact of biases potentially occurring when analyzing RWE using the case of ovarian cancer treatment. Methods: We compared overall survival (OS) with and without second‐line treatment in ovarian cancer patients (n= 1581) using retrospective IMS Oncology electronic medical records. We identified potential confounding and other biases using directed acyclic graphs (DAG). To assess the biases, we applied several analytic approaches starting with simple Cox regression with and without baseline variables, including time‐dependent covariates to reduce immortal time bias, applying the “target trial” approach, including pseudo‐populations and marginal structural models with inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) (causal). We compared hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) to assess the bias associated with each of these approaches compared to the causal analysis. Results: The crude and baseline‐adjusted analyses yielded a HR for second‐line versus no second‐line therapy of 0.565 (95%CI 0.495‐0.645) and 0.535 (95%CI 0.468‐0.613), respectively. Including treatment as a time‐dependent covariate to account for immortal time bias, the corresponding crude and adjusted HR increased to 1.665 (95%CI 1.459‐1.901) and 1.683 (95%CI 1.407‐2.014). Applying a causal (counterfactual) analysis using IPCW and replication yielded a HR of 1.067 (95%CI 1.020‐1.115), which matched the results of a published randomized clinical trial. Conclusions: When using routine RWE data, DAGs can guide the identification of potential biases and variables that need to be controlled for. In our analysis, potential biases were substantial with different directions. Only the application of the target trial and replication approach in combination with a causal analysis matched data from clinical trials.

AB: Objectives: Ovarian cancer is an aggressive disease with poor survival outcomes. Patients are treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy with or without biologic therapy. However, subsequent treatments are not standardized. The aim of this retrospective real world evidence study was to perform a causal analysis for the effect of 2nd‐line treatment on survival in ovarian cancer patients whose cancer progressed after 1st‐line treatment. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study using IMS Oncology electronic medical record (EMR) data. We used directed acyclic graphs (DAG) to identify potential confounding and selection bias. Following the “target trial” approach (Hernan&Robins, 2016), we emulated a trial comparing 2nd‐line treatment immediately after progression to no 2nd‐line treatment using a pseudo‐population. We performed a per protocol analysis with censoring at time of protocol violation and applied inverse probability censoring weighting to account for informative censoring. We used a marginal Cox model to derive causal hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: Out of a total of 17,447 potentially eligible patients, 1,581 patients were included in the analysis. In the 2nd‐line and no 2nd‐line treatment arms, 811 and 574 patients were censored because of protocol violation and 99 and 153 because of loss to follow‐up, respectively. One‐year survival in the 2nd‐line treatment group was 47%, compared to 52% for the no 2nd‐line treatment group. The corresponding HR was 1.067 (95%CI 1.020‐1.115). Conclusions: The estimated HR matched the results of a published randomized clinical trial. Definitive conclusions are not possible, as the study may be limited by unmeasured confounding, as clinical symptoms and imaging were unavailable in the dataset. The DAG suggests that unmeasured confounding leads to an overestimation of the HR. The true HR of 2nd‐line treatment may be below 1.067. Further decision modeling is needed to analyze the benefit‐risk tradeoff.

AB: Real‐world evidence provides important information about the effects of medicines in routine clinical practice. To engender trust that evidence generated for regulatory purposes is sufficiently valid, transparency in the reasoning that underlies study design decisions is critical. Building on existing guidance and frameworks, we developed the Structured Pre‐ and post‐Approval Comparative study design framework to generate valid and transparent real‐world Evidence (SPACE) as a process for identifying design elements and minimal criteria for feasibility and validity concerns, and for documenting decisions. Starting with an articulated research question, we identify key components of the randomized controlled trial needed to maximize validity, and pragmatic choices are considered when required. A causal diagram is used to justify the variables identified for confounding control, and key decisions, assumptions, and evidence are captured in a structured way. In this way, SPACE may improve dialogue and build trust among healthcare providers, patients, regulators, and researchers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Method: This retrospective, observational study used electronic medical records (EMRs) from Predictive Health Intelligence Environment database. Inclusion criteria: adults with T2D; switched to Gla‐300 or IDeg from using Gla‐100 during 6 months before the switch (index date: first switch between 03/01/ 2015‐12/31/2016); active in EMR for >=12 months prior to index date and followed for 6 months after; A1C measures during 6 months before switching (Gla‐300, n = 2,893; IDeg, n = 853). Gla‐300 and IDeg switchers were propensity score matched 1:1 on baseline characteristics. Endpoints were A1C change, hypoglycemia (ICD‐9/ICD‐10 and/or plasma‐glucose level <=70 mg/ dL) incidence and event rate (all hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia associated with hospitalization/emergency‐department service [hospitalization/ED‐related]) during follow‐up. A1C change was analyzed in a patient subgroup with A1C measures at both baseline and 3‐6 months' follow‐up in the matched cohorts. Results: During follow‐up, switching to Gla‐300 (n = 810) and IDeg (n = 810) showed comparable hypoglycemia incidence (all: 11.9% vs 12.7%, respectively, P = 0.45; hospitalization/ ED‐related: 4.4% vs 3.8%, respectively, P = 0.80). Adjusted for baseline hypoglycemia, Gla‐300 and IDeg showed similar hypoglycemia event rate during follow‐up (all: P = 0.88; hospitalization/ ED‐related: P = 0.82). A1C decreased significantly from 8.95% to 8.46% for Gla‐300 (n = 364) and from 8.98% to 8.49% for IDeg (n = 370) (both cohorts: P < 0.01) during follow‐up (comparable reduction in both groups, P = 0.97). Conclusion: In a real‐world setting, T2D patients on Gla‐100 switching to Gla‐300 or IDeg showed comparable glycemic control, hypoglycemia incidence and hypoglycemia event rate.

AB: Objective: To investigate the real‐world safety of ipragliflozin in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Research design and methods: Japanese patients (>65 years old) who were first prescribed ipragliflozin within 3 months after its launch in April 2014 were registered in this post‐marketing surveillance (PMS). Final data collection was in July 2015. Survey items included demographics, treatments, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), vital signs, and laboratory variables. Results: The PMS included 8505 patients (4181 males/4324 females). The mean age and diabetes duration were 72.3 years and 10.6 years, respectively. In 84.3% of patients, ipragliflozin was prescribed at 50 mg/day, which was continued unchanged. Overall, 16.91% of patients experienced 1880 ADRs, and 165 ADRs were classified as serious in 127 patients (1.49%). ADRs of special interest included skin complications, volume depletion, polyuria/pollakiuria, genital infection, urinary tract infection, renal disorders, hypoglycemia, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, malignant tumor, fracture, and ketone body‐related events. Conclusions: This 1‐year PMS revealed probable ADRs in elderly Japanese patients with T2DM prescribed ipragliflozin in real‐world settings, with no new safety concerns.

AB: Background and Aims: Flash Glucose Monitoring (Freestyle LibreTM system) use was assessed in the IMPACT study for glycaemic outcomes and scanning patterns over 6 months. Here, we compare real‐world data with data from IMPACT in a similar population of individuals with well controlled diabetes. Method: De‐identified glucose data from 4793 users over 6 months (12 sensors) were investigated. Only individuals with an Estimated HbA1c ≤ 7.5% during Sensor 1 wear were included. A comparison of time spent in hypoglycaemia (<70 mg/dL) and time spent in serious hypoglycaemia (54 mg/dL or lower) in consecutive 2 week periods over 6 months was made between real‐world and IMPACT data. A comparison of overall scanning frequencies was also made. Results: Comparing time spent in hypoglycaemia, a reduction of 11% was seen from Sensor 1 to Sensor 12 (from 137 min/day to 122 min/day, p = 0.039) in IMPACT and 12% in real‐world data (from 121 min/day to 106 min/day, p < 0.001). A reduction in time spent in serious hypoglycaemia of 13% was seen from Sensor 1 to Sensor 12 (from 55 min/day to 48 min/day, p = 0.112) in IMPACT data and 10% in real‐world data (from 48 min/day to 43 min/day, p < 0.001). Overall average scan rates of 15 scans/ day were observed in IMPACT and 14 scans/day in real‐world data. Conclusion: Freestyle Libre use in the real world demonstrates similar usage patterns and improvements in hypoglycaemia that were observed in clinical trials in individuals with well controlled diabetes.

AB: Objectives: Current cohort oriented statistical methods are well attuned to analyse efficacy in randomized clinical trials. However, to study real‐world patientlevel effectiveness in observational settings, more advanced methods should be used. Such methods should allow for product performance based data labelling and identification of confounding factors of real‐world performance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify such methods, capable of annotating and analysing real‐world data. Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify statistical methods that enable product performance‐based data labelling and that are capable of identifying confounding factors of product performance in a real world context. Results: Classical survival statistics such as Cox proportional hazard modelling is typically used to estimate patient‐level survival gain as drug response. However, Cox proportional hazards models are only useful to model the observed prognostic and predictive markers identified in random clinical trials. Real‐world data offers the potential to identify other confounding factors of real‐world performance, requiring the use of machine learning techniques. Caution should be taken using real‐world data, as measuring product performance in observational studies suffer from selection bias (as opposed to measuring performance in randomized clinical trials). This requires the use of advanced methods like propensity modelling. Conclusions: Classical survival modelling techniques are useful to identify real‐world patient‐level product performance whenever they are supplemented with methods for reducing selection bias. To analyse confounding factors of real‐world product performance, machine learning techniques will be necessary.

AB: Objectives: In the randomised controlled PARADIGM‐HF trial sacubitril/valsartan reduced all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalisations compared to enalapril, an angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), in patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (EF). This was consistent across all subgroups. However, absolute incremental benefits may not be generalisable to the UK HF population, potentially altering the cost‐effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan. The objective of this analysis was to compare cost‐effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan vs. ACEi between the PARADIGM‐HF population and HF populations in real‐world national datasets. Methods: A cost‐utility model was developed based on regression models of all‐cause mortality, all‐cause hospitalisations and EQ‐5D, including patient baseline characteristics as covariates. Costs and quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) were calculated as the average of estimated outcomes for all randomized patients in PARADIGM‐HF (n= 8,399) to determine cost‐effectiveness. Alternative analyses employed weights generated for patients in PARADIGM‐HF using a method called raking, such that selected characteristics of the weighted PARADIGM‐HF population (age and gender) matched those of the UK HF population, as observed in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in England and Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) in Scotland (includes patients with preserved and reduced EF). Results: The average age in PARADIGM‐HF was 64 years, and 22% were women. The average age of patients with HF was 75 and 76 years in the CPRD and SMR datasets respectively and 41% and 49% respectively were women. In the unweighted analysis, sacubitril/ valsartan was associated with incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of £17,939 and £18,348 per QALY using English and Scottish cost data, respectively. In the weighted analyses, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with ICERs of £18,142 and £18,436 per QALY using the CPRD and SMR datasets, respectively. Conclusions: Sacubitril/valsartan remains a cost‐effective treatment vs. ACEi, based on conventional willingness‐to‐pay thresholds (£20,000 per QALY), in the PARADIGM‐HF population and in re‐weighted analyses using real‐world UK HF populations.

AB: Objectives: Payers might be more interested in real‐world effectiveness rather than efficacy of novel treatments. We aimed to assess the use of real‐world evidence along with efficacy data reported in a clinical trial setting (CTS) to estimate effectiveness in a real‐world setting (RWS). Methods: Two RCTs in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were selected. First, patient‐level data (PLD) was extracted from reported Kaplan‐Meier curves for overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazard model and parametric survival models were fitted on PLD. Second, based on reported treatments in respective control arms, similar patient populations were identified from a German sickness fund dataset. Parametric survival models were fitted over the retrieved PLD. This curve was considered to represent the effectiveness of control treatments in RWS. Third, estimated HRs were applied to RWS to estimate OS in active treatment arms. Finally, we estimated mean OS in both CTS and RWS. Results: In NSCLC, estimated mean OS in the CTS was 40.7 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 25.0‐61.1) and 24.8 (95% CI: 17.2‐35.6) for the active and control arms, respectively. In the RWS, estimated mean OS was 15.4 (95% CI: 12.2‐19.8) for the control arm, and based on a HR of 0.61 (95%CI: 0.42‐0.90), the mean OS for the active treatment was 23.3 (95%CI: 16.8‐32.2). In RCC, estimated mean OS in the CTS was 27.8 (95%CI: 17.5‐44.8) and 23.8 (95% CI: 17.1‐33.8) for the active and control arms, respectively. In the RWS, estimated mean OS was 31.4 (95% CI: 23.1‐43.4) for the control arm and based on the HR of 0.72 (95%CI: 0.55‐0.95), the mean OS was 41.8 (95%CI: 32.9‐52.5) for the active arm. Conclusions: If treatment effect is expected to be comparable in both CTS and RWS, this methodology may be used to estimate the effectiveness of novel treatments.

AB: Background: Real world evidence (RWE) studies are of high importance to validate the results observed in clinical trials in larger populations including various ethnical groups and patients with comorbidities like diabetes and CKD. Most patients with hypertension require combination treatment to be able to control their blood pressure (BP). Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of RWE studies carried out with Val/Aml and Val/Aml/HCT in patients with essential hypertension across different countries, ethnical groups and comorbidities like diabetes, metabolic syndrome and renal insufficiency. Results: The cumulative patient exposure from valsartan and its formulations is estimated to be more than 114.5 million patient years and more than 700.000 patients from over 30 countries have been included in prospective or retrospective real world studies of valsartan and its formulations. Thirteen large prospective RWE studies have been carried out with Val/Aml in more than 60.000 patients with hypertension and additional risk factors, like diabetes, metabolic risk or renal insufficiency. The 26 countries involved were Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, China, Egypt, Germany, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Middle East Countries, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, India, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and South‐Central US. The duration of the studies was 8‐26±8 weeks. Mean age was between 48‐64 years. Baseline blood pressure (BP) ranged from 148/86 to 169/100 for mSBP/mDBP. The mean reduction in SBP/DBP at study end was between ‐40.1 to ‐19.6, and ‐27.1 to ‐6.5mmHg, dependent on respective baseline BP. BP control rates achieved ranged from 39% to 78%, dependent on hypertension severities. With the fixed‐dose triple combination Val/Aml/HCT 2 large RWE studies had been carried out in over 8000 hypertensive patients across 14 countries. Mean age was 55 to 65 years, baseline BP for mSBP/mDBP reached from 159/92 to 172/99. Mean reduction in SBP was in the range of ‐43.9 to ‐23.7mmHg and for DBP from ‐21.9 to ‐11.3mmHg. 46.8% to 71.3% of patients achieved BP control. Aml/Val and Aml/Val/HCT was well tolerated with a similar tolerability profile as seen in randomized clincal trials. Conclusion: Data from RWE studies in over 68.000 patients confirms that combination therapy with Val/Aml and Val/Aml/HCT FDC is achieving high rates of BP reduction leading to better BP control across different ethical groups, disease severities and patients with co‐morbidities and was well tolerated.

AB: Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, have been the anticoagulants of choice for many years for patients with AF and other thrombotic conditions. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as alternatives represents a major advance in anticoagulation. DOACs have been found to be at least as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists in randomised, controlled trials for stroke prevention in AF and the management of venous thromboembolism, with real‐world data showing similar outcomes. With the availability of several agents, selecting the most appropriate DOAC can be challenging. The aim of the present article is to provide useful guidance on the implementation of DOAC treatment in clinical practice. Copyright © Radcliffe Cardiology 2017.

AB: Background: Nab‐paclitaxel (Abraxane®, Celgene) plus gemcitabine (G) has proven efficacy and safety as first‐line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC) in the MPACT randomized phase III trial.[1] Here we report on prospective, non‐interventional real‐world data regarding the use of nabpaclitaxel in mPC patients (pts) in the Austrian clinical routine. Methods: Pts with confirmed mPC were treated with nabpaclitaxel plus G and prospectively observed until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results: Between 5/2015 and 7/2017, 179 pts (median age: 68 years, range 44‐89; 86 (48%) > 70) were included across 18 sites. At baseline, 66/168 pts (39%) had ≥ 2 metastatic lesions, 118/163 (72%) had elevated CA19‐9 (> 37 U/ml) and 51/113 pts (45%) had grade 3 disease. At the beginning of treatment 96% had ECOG 0/1, median treatment duration was 4 cycles (range 1‐16). At time of data analysis ORR of 103 evaluable pts was 41% (PR), 41% of pts achieved SD. Nab‐paclitaxel plus G was generally well tolerated with most adverse drug reactions being mild (52%) or moderate (39%) in severity. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was tumor progression or death in 77/121 pts (64%); 5/121 pts (4%) discontinued treatment due to toxicity. No new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: This real‐world data confirm the results of randomized studies. Nab‐paclitaxel plus G was well tolerated and effective in an elderly cohort of mPC patients.

AB: Myeloma patients who become refractory to immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and bortezomib have poor survival, with limited therapeutic options. Pomalidomide has shown improved survival and good tolerability in this patient cohort in clinical trials, but real world data are scarce. We retrospectively analysed all patients treated with pomalidomide at five UK centres between 2013 and 2016. Of 85 patients identified, 70 had sufficient information for response assessments. Median age was 66 years [40‐89], 96.5% were refractory to IMiDs, 72.9% were refractory to both an IMiD and bortezomib and 92.9% were refractory to their last treatment. Of 45 patients with fluorescence in situ hybridization results 64% had adverse risk, 19 patients (22.4%) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 ml/min. Grade >3 non‐haematological toxicities occurred in 42.4%, and grade >3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 38% and 24% respectively, but only 18.8% had dose reductions. The overall response rate was 52.9%. At a median follow‐up of 13.2 months, median progression‐free survival was 5.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.150‐6.238], and median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 11.775‐15.707). No significant difference was seen in response, survival or tolerability by renal function, age or cytogenetic risk. This real‐world data support the results seen in published clinical trials.

AB: Non‐vitamin K‐dependent oral anticoagulants have replaced vitamin K antagonists in thromboembolism prevention in the case of non‐valvular atrial fibrillations as a first choice treatment, based on studies with 4 different substances with tens of thousands of patients, which prove the safety, above all, but also the efficacy of the substances. This is being increasingly reinforced by "real world data", which, despite numerous important limitations, are able to show an overall consistent effect with the large randomized clinical trials. Even in special situations, such as renal failure, fragility and other high‐risk groups, NOACs appear to be superior to vitamin K antagonists. Meanwhile, a direct effective antidote to Dabigatran is available; approval for the antidote for the FXa inhibitor is expected for 2018. In the case of patients with absolute contraindications for anticoagulation, the interventional left atrial appendage occlusion may represent a good alternative option.

AB: Real‐world data are increasingly available to investigate real‐world' safety and efficacy. However, since treatment in observational studies is not randomly allocated, confounding by indication may occur, in which differences in patient characteristics may influence both treatment choices and treatment responses. A popular method to adjust for this type of bias is the use of propensity scores (PS). The PS is a score between 0 and 1 that reflects the likelihood per patient of receiving one of the treatment categories of interest conditional on a set of variables. At least in theory, in patients with similar PS, the treatment prescribed will be independent of these variables (pseudorandomisation). But researchers using PS sometimes fail to recognise important methodological flaws which can lead to spurious conclusions. These include perfect prediction of treatment allocation, untied observations and lack of generalisability due to oversimplification of complex clinical scenarios. In this viewpoint we will discuss the most commonly encountered flaws and provide a stepwise description on the estimation and use of PS, such that in future publications these flaws can be avoided.

AB: Background In phase III registration trials, ritonavir boosted paritaprevir, with ombitasvir and dasabuvir (PrOD) +/‐ ribavirin was safe, well tolerated and had excellent efficacy with SVR12 rates >95%. However, real‐world data on the safety and efficacy of PrOD therapy in cirrhotic patients is limited. Methods Between October 2014 and July 2015, a compassionate access program supported by AbbVie Pty Ltd was conducted in Australia across 47 treatment centers. Patients were included if they received at least one dose of PrOD. Primary end‐points were SVR12 (HCV viral load < LLOQ at least 12 weeks post treatment) and drug discontinuation rates due to adverse events. The frequency and nature of serious adverse events with particular focus on death, hepatic decompensation and grade 4 biochemical abnormalities were collected. Results In this current analysis of 461 patients (74% cirrhosis, 9.8% CPB) complete treatment outcome data was available in 86% (n=395), with an overall SVR of 95.5%. SVR12 rates were similar for cirrhotic and non‐cirrhotic patients (95.5% and 97.8%, respectively). Most patients were infected with Genotype 1a (64%) and most received ribavirin (90%). Baseline features of the fully characterized patients are shown in Table 1. Similar to previous reports, baseline viral load, MELD score and liver stiffness did not influence SVR. Early cessation of therapy occurred in 6.1% of patients and in these patients SVR12 was lower at 53%. Hyperbilirubinaemia on therapy was common with 4.3% of patients developing hyperbilirubinaemia > 100mumol/L. To date no deaths have been reported, 34 patients (7.4%) required hospital admission, 9 patients (2.0%) developed hepatic decompensation, Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in 10 patients (2.2%). Conclusion In a real‐world setting, treatment with PrOD in Genotype 1 HCV infection achieves excellent SVR12 rates including in those with cirrhosis. Hepatic decompensation occurred infrequently.

AB: Fresh water scarcity has led to increased use of reclaimed wastewater as an alternative and reliable source for crop irrigation. Beyond microbiological safety, concerns have been raised regarding contamination of reclaimed wastewater by xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug which is ubiquitously detected in reclaimed wastewater, highly persistent in soil, and taken up by crops. In a randomized controlled trial we demonstrate that healthy individuals consuming reclaimed wastewater‐irrigated produce excreted carbamazepine and its metabolites in their urine, while subjects consuming fresh water‐irrigated produce excreted undetectable or significantly lower levels of carbamazepine. We also report that the carbamazepine metabolite pattern at this low exposure level differed from that observed at therapeutic doses. This "proof of concept" study demonstrates that human exposure to xenobiotics occurs through ingestion of reclaimed wastewater‐irrigated produce, providing real world data which could guide risk assessments and policy designed to ensure the safe use of wastewater for crop irrigation.

AB: Clinical trial designs often fail to deliver data that jointly satisfy evolving demands of both regulatory and reimbursement authorities. We propose a new multi‐tiered trial design to integrate efficacy and effectiveness, and address the evolving needs of authorities. The mixed randomized trial allocates patients first to trial arm ‐ randomized controlled, pragmatic (randomized) or observational ‐ and then to treatment group ‐ experimental, placebo, active comparator, best available therapy or standard of care. Trial arms may be staggered over time to reflect the current state of randomized and non‐randomized data of the experimental drug, and thereby still prioritize safety. At the same time, the mixed randomized trial allows for the collection of real‐world data in a randomized setting, and thereby reduces selection bias. Copyright © 2016 Jonathan Alsop.

AB: Vildagliptin is one of the most extensively studied dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors in terms of its clinical utility. Over the last decade, a vast panorama of evidence on the benefit‐risk profile of vildagliptin has been generated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this article, we review the cumulative evidence on the safety of vildagliptin from the clinical development programme, as well as reports of rare adverse drug reactions detected during the post‐marketing surveillance of the drug. Across clinical studies, the overall safety and tolerability profile of vildagliptin was similar to placebo, and it was supported by real‐world data in a broad population of patients with T2DM, making DPP‐4 inhibitors, like vildagliptin, a safe option for managing patients with T2DM.

AB: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a useful tool in detecting the latent relationship between two sets of multivariate variables. In theoretical analysis of CCA, a regularization technique is utilized to investigate the consistency of its analysis. This letter addresses the consistency property of CCA from a least squares view. We construct a constrained empirical risk minimization framework of CCA and apply a two‐stage randomized Kaczmarz method to solve it. In the first stage, we remove the noise, and in the second stage, we compute the canonical weight vectors. Rigorous theoretical consistency is addressed. The statistical consistency of this novel scenario is extended to the kernel version of it. Moreover, experiments on both synthetic and real‐world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

AB: Objectives: To model cost utility of human leukocyte transfer factor for parenteral use (TF) in adult and pediatric patients suffering from cellular immunodeficiency (CID), based on effectiveness data from retrospective study observing decreasing frequency of respiratory (RTI) and/or urinary (UTI) tract infections, prostatitis and/ or vulvovaginitis episodes. Methods: The decision tree model developed in Excel using real world data from an observational multicenter retrospective realized in the period from July 2014 to December 2014 in 14 centers in Slovakia. The primary objective was to evaluate the cost utility based on effectiveness by assessment of the number of documented infections over one year since start of the treatment as compared to the last year of the pre‐treatment period. The systematic review was run to get utility value for RTI, UTI, prostatitis and vulvovaginitis episodes. Results: Calculated incremental cost utility ratio was 6.639,25 /QALY based on the sample (181 patients) was predominantly female (74,6 %) and the average age was 44 with a range of 6 to 82. The most common recurrent episodes were RTI occurring 558 times at average in the year before TF initiation, followed by UTI and vulvovaginitis episodes. The significant reduction was observed in RTI, UTI and vulvov aginitis episodes after treatment with TF. Respiratory tract infection where reduced from 558 to 184 a year before versus after initiation of TF application (p‐valuemax< 0,025). Significant reduction was achieved in UTI and vulvovaginitis episodes. Moreover lower resource use was measured in the need of antibiotic treatment and hospitalizations. Univariate sensitivity analysis was run based on Slovak guidelines with the result 4.647,48 ‐ 9.484,65 EUR/QALY. Conclusions: The calculated cost utility ratio together with the real world data about the reduction of recurrence of infection's episode in adult and pediatric patient with CID show that treatment using human TF is cost effective below the threshold set in Slovakia.

DOI: 10.1159/000487109
AB: Purpose: One of the most effective chemotherapies for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is nab‐paclitaxel (nab‐P) which is approved for the treatment of MBC after failure of 1st‐line therapy and when anthracyclines are not indicated. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have shown high efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Real world data of nab‐P in MBC, however, are still limited. Methods: The prospective multicenter non‐interventional study NABUCCO was designed to collect real‐world data on the routine treatment of 700 patients with MBC in oncology outpatient centers across Germany. Primary objective was time to tumor progression (TTP), secondary objectives were overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), safety and quality of life. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Results: Between 4/2012 and 4/2015 705 pts with MBC at 128 active sites had been enrolled. 697 patients (pts) were evaluable. Baseline characteristics: Median age 62.3 years (range 29.2‐89.3), ECOG PS ≥ 2 n = 49 (7.0%), prior taxanes 419 pts (60.1%), 70.4% of pts received nab‐P in a weekly pattern, 27.8% triweekly. Median TTP was 5.9 months (95% CI 5.6‐6.4), ORR was 37.2%, median OS 15.5 months (95% CI 14.2‐17.3). 34.3% of pts developed adverse events grade 3/4 including leukopenia (7.9%), neutropenia (4.0%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.3%). Global and breast cancer related quality of life were not affected. Conclusions: The results of the NABUCCO study confirm the RCT outcomes, the favorable benefit‐risk profile of nab‐P and the sustained global quality of life in patients with MBC in real‐world.

AB: Objectives: Although the demonstration of improved patient and clinical outcomes within randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is widely accepted as foundational evidence of the efficacy of new treatments, concerns are frequently expressed that RCTs lack external validity. GetReal, a project under the umbrella of the Innovation in Medicine Initiative, is exploring how “real‐life” clinical data can be brought in earlier in drug development. Methods: We describe a case study that considers lung cancer the most common cancer worldwide. It investigates the generalizability of efficacy (overall survival [OS]) from the pivotal trial of pemetrexed vs gemcitabine use for the treatment of non‐squamous NSCLC (Scagliotti et al 2008), using real‐world data from the prospective observational FRAME study (Moro‐Sibilot 2015) in a reweighting approach. Both inverse propensity scoring and entropy balancing were used to reweight RCT data based on real‐world data to attempt to mirror routine clinical practice in the trial setting. Results: Although OS differences between pemetrexed and gemcitabine appear more pronounced after reweighting, the reweighted analysis of the clinical trial yielded a hazard ratio (HR) closer to 1, with greater uncertainty: HR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.60 to 1.33) compared with 0.81 (95% CI: 0.70 to 0.94) in a similar population in the clinical trial. Sensitivity analyses to both the methods of reweighting and the inclusion of baseline covariates gave broadly similar results. Conclusions: < span> The key objective of this case study was to assess the generalizability of RCT results for the treatment of non‐squamous NSCLC when projected to a real‐world population. Tested reweighting efforts did not seem to invalidate findings from the original RCT.

AB: Objectives: Treating cancer is an important health care outcome but it is costly. Increasing numbers of anti‐cancer treatments are becoming available. These new treatments can be used as new additional lines of therapy ‐ where treatments are used in succession after the failure of previous treatments. Randomised controlled trials rarely involve multiple lines of therapy. Therefore, the relationship between treatments, cost and the effectiveness require real‐world data. This study estimates the cost per month for lines of therapy in the Australian health system. Methods: An analysis of the cost per month of a prospective advanced cancer Australian cohort (228 patients) was undertaken. Activity was identified from reimbursement and administrative databases and costed. Lines of therapy were estimated from medical notes. A panel of multiple observations for individuals over time was constructed. Multivariate regression was undertaken to control for confounders. Price changes were calculated to maintain the cost as estimated in the initial line of therapy. Results: The total cost of the cohort was $AUD 19,000,000. The mean cost per month was $4,384. The cost in the first line was approximately $4,000 and increased to $8,000 per month for later lines of therapy. The results of the multivariate analysis suggested cost rose by $1,700 per month in the second line to $2,400 per month in the fifth line of therapy after adjusting for confounders. It was estimated that price reductions of 28% (95% CI 14 to 40%) would be required to return the cost per month to original levels. Conclusions: Real‐world data is not easy to obtain, and analyses need careful adjustment for confounding. This information is required to ensure that the relationship between costs and survival is understood, appropriate policies introduced and the impacts of the policies are able to be monitored. The results of this study need to be confirmed in other cohorts. Copyright © 2018

AB: BACKGROUND: Patients with decompensated HCV have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Recently, the FDA approved treatment with LDV/SOF+RBV in GT 1 decompensated patients based on the SOLAR‐1 and ‐2 studies. Real‐world datasets are important to show generalizability of clinical trial data. Here, real‐world data from the UK expanded access program (EAP) are compared to clinical trial data in decom pensated HCV patients. METHODS: Data from 2 open‐label phase‐2 trials (SOLAR‐1 and ‐2) are compared to real‐world data from the UK EAP collected through Month 6 in CPT‐B and CPT‐C HCV patients treated with LDV/SOF+RBV. The UK EAP cohort was selected based on its size and availability of comparable data. SVR and relapse rates, MELD improvement, and safety are presented. RESULTS: High SVR rates were observed in SOLAR‐1 and ‐2 (87.0%) and the UK EAP (89.7%). MELD improvements >3 at Month 6 were similar within CPT class for SOLAR‐1 and ‐2 and the EAP among those achieving SVR (23.8% vs. 17.0% for CPT‐B and 38.2% vs. 33.3% for CPT‐C, respectively). LDV/SOF+RBV was generally safe and well‐tolerated. Death rates were low (2.0‐5.2%), not attributed to treatment, and more frequently observed in CPT‐C patients. See Table 1. CONCLUSIONS: HCV GT 1 patients with decompensated cirrhosis achieve high cure rates and comparable MELD improvement with LDV/SOF+RBV in clinical trials and the real‐world. Safety was consistent with known disease progression in this population with advanced liver disease. The impact of SVR and MELD improvement on long‐term clinical outcomes is unknown.

We explored the use and limitations of real‐world data for the economic evalua‐tiMETHODS: Real‐world data were gathered from the Dutch population‐based Cancer Registry supplemented with data from medical records. Patients additionally treated with oxaliplatin (N = therapy (N = results from the randomised controlled trial (RCT) that demonstrated a significantly improved disease‐free survival with oxaliplatin, on which currguidelines are based. RESULTS: Patients receiving oxaliplatin are significantly younger and have fewer comorbidities than patients receiving alternative chemotherapy. Median follow‐up time of the study was 26.6 months. The adjusted hazadisease‐free survival of 0.84 indicated that oxaliplatin was more effective. However, the 95% confidence interval of 0.35‐2.03 revealed large uncertainty about the actual effectiveness in daily clinical practice. Moreover, residual confounding could not be ruled out. On the other hand, patient characteristics, treatment patterns, comparator arm, dosages, toxicities, resource use, costs and disease‐free survival outcomes obtained in clinical daily practice showed great similarities with the RCT based data and results. During our study, extended 6‐year RCT follow‐up results became avail‐able which confirmed previous findings. CONCLUSIONS: Insight into patient char‐acteristics, treatment patterns, dosage and toxicities observed in daily clinical prais very useful in determining the extent to which RCT results are generalisable to a real‐world setting. However, outcomes research alone does not necessarily lead to internally valid and precise estimates of effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness. In these situations, assessment of real‐world cost‐effectiveness should be based on a careful synthesis of RCT results and real‐world observations.

We aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of possible quality standards for intersite comparisons of outcomes of providing Aflibercept for neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (nAMD) in clinical practice.Patients and methodsRetrospective data analysis from an electronic medical record. A consecutive series of treatment‐naive patients initiated on aflibercept for nAMD, in the UK from March 2013 to October 2015. Age, visual acuity (VA) at baseline and 1 year, and injection episodes were remotely extracted in an anonymised format.ResultsThe mean baseline VA was 54.3 letters, ranging from 51.3 to 58.1 between different centres, in 5620 eyes taken from 12 centres. Out of these, 3360 were initiated on treatment more than a year before. The percentage with <35 letters at baseline was 19.9‐3% and that with >70 letters was 24.8‐10.7%. Eyes with ≥70 letters at 1 year ranged from 20.2 to 42.9% and those with <35 ranged from 4.5 to 21.6% across different sites. Injection rates in 1 year varied from 5.5 to 8.6, and data available at 1 year also varied from 82.3 to 46.4%.ConclusionsSignificant variation was found between sites attempting to provide the same therapeutic regime. For fair comparisons between sites, we recommend that both VA measures and process measures, such as injection numbers, retention rates, and discharge policies, are used. More work is required to explain the differences. Such real‐world data are not generated in the same way as a randomised clinical trial, and maybe best used to help improve service provision.

AB: Background. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the largest subtype of indolent non‐ Hodgkin lymphoma. FL is incurable and median overall survival ranges from six to ten years. The EORTC 20981 trial revealed longer progression‐free survival (median 3.7 versus 1.3 years) after treatment with rituximab maintenance compared to observation. While randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the golden standard for establishing effectiveness, the generalizability in daily clinical practice is limited. Therefore, health policy makers and clinicians increasingly require information on outcomes in unselected patient populations which are not treated under the idealised circumstances created in RCTs. Aims. Using real world data, we evaluate cost‐effectiveness of rituximab maintenance compared to observation in FL patients responding to second line chemotherapy. Methods. A population based registry was created including patients with non‐ Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in the Netherlands since 2004. We selected patients with follicular lymphoma who responded to second line chemotherapy. Data was collected from medical patient records on patient characteristics, resource utilisation, treatment information (e.g. regimens, dosages and number of cycles) and treatment outcomes (e.g. response and survival). A costeffectiveness model was applied to calculate cost per life year gained (LYG) and quality adjusted life year (QALY). Results. Our database contained 1457 patients with non‐Hodgkin lymphoma including 545 patients diagnosed with FL. The observation group consisted of 46 patients responding to second line chemotherapy. The maintenance group included 33 patients receiving rituximab maintenance after second induction treatment. Median age was 60 [Range 34‐82] and 62 years [Range 30‐92] in the observation and maintenance group and not significantly different. Differences between the two groups were found for response to prior treatment (p=0.032) and prior treatment with rituximab in the second line (p=0.004). Besides, non‐significant differences for B‐symptoms and distribution of the FLIPI score were found. Compared to the EORTC 20981 trial, patients in the registry were older (p=0.0006) and although substantial variation across patients was observed, dosage, number of cycles and duration of treatment were comparable to the trial. We investigated overall survival (OS) and this was significantly better in the maintenance group (p = 0.021) compared to the observation group, although median OS was not reached. Incremental cost per LYG and QALY were low with € 5,156 per QALY and € 5,246 per LYG. Extensive sensitivity analyses did not change the results. While the results in our study are based on real world data and will be more generalizable to daily clinical practice, both OS and costs should be interpreted with caution since observed dissimilarities between the observation and maintenance groups suggested that the groups represent different types of patients. Conclusions. FL patients in daily practice are not identical to the patients in the EORTC 20981 trial emphasising the importance of studying real world data. However, analysing non‐randomised patient groups is challenging because of the differences between the observation and maintenance group and therefore results should be interpreted carefully. However, we do find that in this real world setting, cost‐effectiveness ratios for maintenance treatment with rituximab are low compared to other haematological treatments.

AB: Purpose: Sevelamer, a noncalcium phosphate binder, has been shown to attenuate the progression of vascular calcification and improve survival in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis compared with calcium‐based binders. Using real‐world data from a cohort study and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database, we conducted a cost‐effectiveness analysis comparing sevelamer with calcium acetate in dialysis patients from the perspective of the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. Methods: Data (demographic, diagnostic, laboratory, and survival) from 4674 patients undergoing dialysis enrolled in a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted in South Korea between September 2008 and December 2012 were linked to phosphate binder use, hospitalization, and cost data available from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. After propensity score matching, a dataset comprising comparable patients treated with either sevelamer (n = 501) or calcium acetate (n = 501) was used in the cost‐effectiveness analysis. A Markov model was used to estimate costs, life years, quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost‐effectiveness over each patient's lifetime. Forty‐month treatment‐specific overall survival (OS) data available from the dataset were extrapolated to lifetime survival with the use of regression analysis. Findings: Patients had a mean age of 56.3 years and were treated with dialysis for a mean duration of 67.6 months. Compared with calcium acetate, sevelamer was associated with an incremental cost of South Korean Won ([U+20A9]) 12,246,911 ($10,819) and a gain of 1.758 life years and 1.108 QALYs per patient. This outcome yielded incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios of [U+20A9]6,966,350 ($6154) and [U+20A9]11,057,699 ($9768) per life year and QALY gained, respectively. Conclusions regarding sevelamer's cost‐effectiveness were insensitive to alternative assumptions in time horizon, discount rate, hospitalization rate, costs, and health utility estimates, and they remained consistent in 100% of the model iterations, considering a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of [U+20A9]31,894,720 ($28,176) per QALY gained. Implications: This analysis of real‐world data found that sevelamer's higher cost relative to calcium acetate was adequately offset by improved survival among patients undergoing dialysis in South Korea. As such, sevelamer offers good value for money, representing a cost‐effective alternative to calcium‐based binders. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

DOI: 10.1093/europace/euy204.031
AB: Background: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is associated with increased morbidity and in patients with previous myocardial infarction there is an increased risk of sudden death. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of catheter ablation over medications in improving morbidity in patients with recurrent VT and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). As a result the threshold for referring for VT ablation has fallen over recent years and this has led to increasing numbers of cases being performed. Given the paucity of real world data since the emergence of distinct patient selection criteria we sought to present our single centre experience. Methods: VT ablation cases performed at University Hospital Coventry were prospectively recorded into a registry. Follow up data were obtained from review of medical electronic records. The primary endpoint for normal heart VT was death, cardiovascular (CV) hospitalisation and VT recurrence (spontaneous VT or holter evidence of premature ventricular complex burden>1% with symptoms, or>10% if asymptomatic). The primary endpoint for non‐normal heart VT was arrhythmic death, VT storm (more than 3 episodes in 24 hours) or appropriate shocks. Results: Forty seven patients underwent a total of 53 catheter ablations for VT from January 2012 to January 2018. Mean age±SD was 57±15 yrs, 68% male, 81% Caucasian, 66% elective. Aetiology of VT included normal heart (49%), ICM (36%), dilated cardiomyopathy (9%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (4%) and valvular heart disease (2%). Normal heart VT was predominantly of right ventricular outflow tract origin (85%). Medications at baseline included betablockers (91%), amiodarone (43%), verapamil (8%), flecainide (4%) and anticoagulation (60%). Cases were mostly performed with conscious sedation (89%). Median procedural time was 200 mins (interquartile range [IQR] 141‐241), fluoroscopy time 27 mins (IQR 19‐34) and radiofrequency ablation time 22 mins (IQR 11‐48). Catheter ablation was acutely successful in 91% of procedures and there were 6 major procedural complications in total (11%). These included 3 pericardial effusions that required no intervention, 1 case of pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis, 1 case of cardiac perforation requiring surgical correction and 1 groin haematoma managed conservatively. In 46 patients followed up after a median of 200 days (IQR 94‐571), the composite outcome occurred in 28% of patients. There were 2 non‐arrhythmic deaths in total (4%) and 6 CV hospitalisations (13%). This cohort included 19 ICM (36%) with acute procedural success of 95%. At median Follow‐up of 152 days (IQR 102‐254) the primary outcome occurred in 22% of patients while further VT storm/appropriate shocks occurred in 3 patients (17%). Conclusions: Our real world data shows that catheter ablation for normal and structural heart VT is safe, associated with a high rate of acute procedural success and long‐term success rates comparable to randomized controlled studies.

AB: Background Real‐world data of current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used to treat focal seizures is of importance to understand the efficacy and safety outside of the clinical trial setting. Here we report real‐world data from a large series of patients treated with perampanel for 1 year. Methods FYDATA was a multicentre, retrospective, 1‐year observational study assessing the efficacy and safety of adjuvant perampanel in patients >12 years of age with focal epilepsy in a real‐world setting. At 12 months, the proportion of patients who were seizure free, median percentage seizure reduction, proportion of responders, retention rate and proportion of patients with adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Analyses were also performed to identify any patient‐, medication‐ and disease‐related factors associated with a large clinical response or carry a risk for AEs. Results A total of 464 patients were included in the study with a retention rate of 60.6% at 1 year. The mean number of prior AEDs was 7.8. The median percentage reduction in overall seizures was 33.3% (75% for secondary generalised seizures) after 1 year, with 7.2% of patients achieving seizure freedom. Furthermore, patients on non‐enzyme‐inducing AEDs were more likely to achieve seizure freedom, and logistic regression revealed that patients aged >65 years, those with epilepsy due to a vascular aetiology and those who had received fewer prior AEDs showed a better clinical response to perampanel. A total of 62.9% of the patients experienced AEs at 12 months; dizziness, somnolence and irritability were the most frequent AEs. Patients with prior psychiatric comorbidities (hyperactivity and personality disorder) were more likely to experience psychiatric AEs with perampanel, and slower titration schedules were associated with less AEs overall. Conclusion Perampanel, for the treatment of focal epilepsy in a real‐world setting in a refractory population, over 1 year, demonstrates a similar efficacy and safety profile to that observed in clinical trials. Our results have implications for the optimisation of perampanel use in a clinical setting. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB: Background: Recent progress and better understanding of cancer immunology led to the development of anti‐PD‐1 antibody, which directed against the negative immunoregulatory cell surface receptor PD‐1. Anti‐PD‐1 antibody nivolumab has been approved for advanced melanoma in Japan. Although there have been clinical trial reports on nivolumab treatment for advanced melanoma, the real‐world data for nivolumab efficacy in Asian patient cohort is still lacking. The aim of this study is to obtain the real‐world data for nivolumab efficacy in Japanese advanced melanoma patients. Methods: This prospective observational study was performed on unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients who were treated with nivolumab at a dose of 2mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or 3mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W). Primary endpoints are response rate (RR), and overall survival(OS). Biomarker analyses will also be planned at separate time points (before treatment, at 7, 13, 19, and 25 weeks). Results: In total, 125 patients from 22 institutions in Japan were enrolled between Dec. 2015 and Dec. 2017. Mucosal melanoma (25%) was the most frequent subtype in this study, followed by acral lentiginous melanoma (20%), nodular melanoma (16%), superficial spreading melanoma (13%), uveal melanoma (3%), and lentigo maligna melanoma (2%). Forty‐eight patients (38%) were previously treated with any systemic therapies. We observed a CR in 1 (1%), PR in 21 (17%), SD in 34 (27%), and PD in 51 patients (49%) (objective RR: 18%). The difference of nivolumab dose (2mg/kg Q3W vs 3mg/kg Q2W) did not show significant difference in RR (objective RR, 17% vs 21%, P = 0.77; disease‐control rate 41.1% vs 50%, P = 0.44, respectively). Use of nivolumab as a first‐line treatment showed a tendency toward higher response than as a second‐line treatment (objective RR, 20% vs 8%, P = 0.12). Conclusions: This interim analysis showed lower RR than that in the recent phase III randomized trials reported from western countries. The difference from western countries in proportion of subtypes of melanoma, having higher proportion of mucosal and acral melanoma, and the involvement of the second‐line use of nivolumab will probably lead to lower RR to nivolumab in Japan.

AB: Aims: To examine the efficacy and safety of non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants in people with both atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus. Methods: We reviewed efficacy and safety data from the warfarin‐controlled phase III non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants trials (ARISTOTLE, RE‐LY, ROCKET‐AF, ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48) and their post hoc analyses with regard to diabetes status. We also reviewed the updated literature regarding this population. Results: At baseline 20‐40% of the participants in the phase III non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants trials had diabetes mellitus at baseline. This population, in comparison with those without diabetes, was more likely to have other comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease; thus, their cardiovascular risk was higher. Participants with diabetes had higher rates of stroke and systemic embolism than participants without diabetes. This risk was decreased using non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants, with no significant interaction by diabetic status or the specific drug used. Overall, compared with warfarin, non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants were safe and reduced the incidence of major bleeding in people with atrial fibrillation and diabetes, although the results varied with the different non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants. Conclusions: The efficacy and safety of non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin generally extend to participants with diabetes mellitus, although dedicated randomized trials or real‐world data are lacking.

AB: Purpose: A composite end point (CE) measuring neonatal benefit was created for use in tocolytic randomized controlled trials with rates assessed using data from one referral hospital. The goal of this study was to assess wider generalizability of the CE, using data from multiple integrated delivery networks, creating a cohort of linked mother‐neonate pairs to understand neonatal outcomes in a broad population. Methods: Retrospective data on births (2001‐2012) were collected from 4 US integrated delivery networks in the COMparative effectiveness PAtient Safety and Surveillance (COMPASS) Research Network, and linked mother‐neonate pairs were identified. The CE was analyzed for all in‐hospital singleton neonates at >=24 weeks of gestational age (GA) born to mothers aged <=45 years at a referral hospital or hospital with >2000 annual births. Results: The CE analyses included 56 485 eligible mother‐neonate pairs; frequency of the CE decreased from 89% to 66% between GA weeks 24 and 29 and further decreased to <14% for infants born >34 weeks of GA. Composite end point rates were 20% to 30% lower at 24 to 30 weeks of GA in COMPASS compared with Medical University of South Carolina but were similar by 31 weeks. Conclusions: The COMPASS Network enabled evaluation of the CE across a large population demonstrating that the CE findings could be replicated beyond a single hospital and the potential for lower CE frequency. Based on this, an adaptive design was adopted for randomized controlled trials, specifically sample size reestimation to mitigate against the risk of lower outcome rates, highlighting the use of real‐world data in drug development.

AB: Introduction: Reimbursement of amyloid–positron emission tomography (PET) is lagging due to the lack of definitive evidence on its clinical utility and cost‐effectiveness. The Amyloid Imaging to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease–Diagnostic and Patient Management Study (AMYPAD‐DPMS) is designed to fill this gap. Methods: AMYPAD‐DPMS is a phase 4, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study. Nine hundred patients with subjective cognitive decline plus, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia possibly due to Alzheimer's disease will be randomized to ARM1, amyloid‐PET performed early in the diagnostic workup; ARM2, amyloid‐PET performed after 8 months; and ARM3, amyloid‐PET performed whenever the physician chooses to do so. Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the difference between ARM1 and ARM2 in the proportion of patients receiving a very‐high‐confidence etiologic diagnosis after 3 months. Secondary endpoints address diagnosis and diagnostic confidence, diagnostic/therapeutic management, health economics and patient‐related outcomes, and methods for image quantitation. Expected Impacts: AMYPAD‐DPMS will supply physicians and health care payers with real‐world data to plan management decisions.

AB: Background: Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated substantial benefit of thrombectomy in patients with proximal anterior circulation arterial occlusion. Cost effectiveness estimates of thrombectomy need to include not only effects on the health care system, but also a societal perspective (social services and nursing home care). Methods: A Markov state transition cohort model was constructed to estimate costs and outcomes in a 25‐year perspective. Treatment outcome was based on pooled modified Rankin Scale (mRS) data at 3 months from five published RCTs, and recent age‐specific survival data from Riksstroke grouped by mRS score. Resource use for the post‐acute care,, social services and nursing home care was linked to mRS and data from Riksstroke for a sample of 710 patients with NIHSS>7 treated with thrombolysis during 2014. A 3% discount rate was applied on future costs and benefits. Results: While thrombectomy can be expected to increase the health care cost per patient (+ SEK 117 000) (EUR 1 =SEK 9.35) mainly because of intervention costs, the reduced burden on the social services including home help services (‐SEK 169 000) and nursing home care (‐SEK 331 000) implies cost savings at the societal level. The average patient gain was 1.0 QALY with higher gains for younger age groups. Conclusions: Based on real world data from Riksstroke, thrombectomy therapy in patients matching those in recent RCTs, may lead to substantial cost savings in the social service sector, more than 3 times the increase in health care costs.

AB: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established and approved procedure with an increasing implantation rate, whilst the number of surgical aortic valve replacements (SAVR) remained unchanged (AQUA data). This demonstrates that more patients who were unsuitable for SAVR were treated with TAVI. First randomized trials have shown a significant survival benefit for TAVI compared to conservative therapy (PARTNER B) and non‐inferiority to SAVR in high‐risk patients (PARTNER A). The US pivotal trials demonstrated even a significant survival benefit in TAVI patients compared to SAVR. The current 5‐year data of the PARTNER trials demonstrate a long‐term durability of the TAVI valves, which even have superior hemodynamic parameters. Increasing experience, optimization and evolution of the TAVI systems lead to better results and lower rates of complications and mortality, as was shown by the „real world data“ from the German aortic valve registry (GARY). The analysis of the subgroups and also the Nordic aortic valve intervention (NOTION) study showed equivalent results for TAVI and SAVR in patients with intermediate and low risk. There is a trend to expand the indications to patients with intermediate risk and the currently ongoing large prospective and randomized trials SURTAVI and PARTNER II could provide greater clarity.

AB: Incomplete thrombus resolution in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) may increase the risk of recurrent thromboembolic events and other complications, such as post‐thrombotic syndrome. Various options exist for thrombus resolution, including systemic thrombolytic agents, catheter‐directed thrombolysis, and traditional anticoagulants such as heparins or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Data are accumulating on the use of non‐VKA oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, and these may provide greater thrombus resolution compared with VKAs. Data from the phase III rivaroxaban studies presented here show that a 21‐day intensive dosing regimen of rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily is effective during the acute treatment phase for VTE, with similar recurrence rates and thrombus resolution to standard anticoagulation. Pooled analyses of phase III studies have also indicated that rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily monotherapy for up to 12 months after this initial intensive treatment period may provide effective prevention of recurrent VTE and a reduction in the risk of major bleeding, irrespective of clot burden. Four case studies from the Darmstadt Academic Teaching Hospital, Germany, and Gunma University Hospital, Japan, are also provided. Further clinical studies and real‐world data may improve our understanding of initial intensive dose regimens, and assess the full significance of thrombus burden in VTE.

AB: Background: Data regarding the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT/VF) are limited and conflicting. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between CRT‐induced reverse remodeling and VT/VF occurrence in patients wearing implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator with CRT (CRT‐D). Methods: Patients indicated to CRT‐D implant were prospectively followed up in 74 Italian Cardiology Centers. Echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular volume (LVESV) and function (LVEF) were performed before CRT‐D implant and at first follow‐up, scheduled after hospital discharge. Baseline and follow‐up echo data were compared and patients with LVEF relative increase > 10% or LVESV relative reduction >15% were considered CRT responder. All VT/VF episodes stored by the CRT‐D devices after CRT response assessment were reviewed by expert electrophysiologists, blinded to patient outcomes, and classified. Research endpoint was the annual rate of patients and episodes with appropriate ICD shocks and the annual rate of appropriate ICD shocks. Results: 1402 patients (81% male, mean age 66 +/‐ 10 years old) were followed for a median observation period of 16 months. CRT responders were 1033 (74%) patients. Annual rates of patients, episodes and therapies with appropriate ICD shocks are shown in the figure, with incidence rate ratios showing the reduction of ICD shocks annual rates comparing CRT responder and non‐responder patients. Conclusion: Real‐world data of a multicenter observational research show that LV reverse remodeling after CRT is associated with significant reduction of appropriate ICD shocks.

AB: Background and Aims: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) demonstrated potent and sustainable antiviral efficacy and a good safety profile in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in controlled clinical trials. Real‐world data are important to confirm effectiveness and safety data in patient populations encountered in routine clinical practice. Methods: This non‐interventional, prospective, 36‐month study included treatment‐naive and treatment‐experienced patients with CHB initiating their first TDF regimen (monotherapy or combination therapy) in routine clinical practice in France. Clinical, virologic, biochemical, compliance, and safety data were collected. Results: Data from 440 consecutive patients from 58 centers were analyzed. The majority of the cohort was male (71 %), hepatitis B "e" antigen‐negative (HBeAg‐) (74 %), and treatment‐experienced (56 %); 11 % were aged >65 years; and comorbidities were reported in 39 %. After 12 months, 92 % of the overall cohort achieved virologic response (HBV DNA <69 IU/mL) which was maintained to 36 months (96 %); virologic response was achieved by >90 % of patients irrespective of HBeAg status, age, or prior treatment history. At 36 months, 77 % of patients had normal alanine aminotransferase levels. Fourteen patients lost hepatis B surface (HBs) antigen, and seven seroconverted to anti‐HBs. TDF was well tolerated over the 36‐month study, including in 14 women who became pregnant during the study. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change markedly from baseline irrespective of prior treatment history. Conclusions: TDF demonstrated potent virologic and biochemical responses across a broad range of patients reflective of routine clinical practice. The safety profile was consistent with results from pivotal trials. Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).

AB: BACKGROUND The COMBO stent (OrbusNeich, The Netherlands) is a bio‐engineered drug eluting stent with a sirolimus‐eluting coating and an anti‐CD34+ antibody layer, which attracts circulating endothelial progenitor cells. These cells can differentiate into endothelial cells and provide early endothelialization. These specific characteristics may prevent neointima formation and restenosis, and improve clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention. To date, no real‐world data is available on two year clinical results of this novel device. METHODS The prospective, investigator‐initiated, multicenter, European REMEDEE Registry evaluates clinical outcomes after deployment of the abluminal sirolimus coated bio‐engineered stent. A 1000 patients were enrolled into the registry between June 2013 and March 2014. Baseline and lesion characteristics presented a high risk allcomers patient population. The primary endpoint was target lesion failure (TLF) at 12 months, consisting of cardiac death, target vesselmyocardial infarction and target lesion failure. The 5.7% TLF has been presented atTCT 2015. Two year follow‐up for all patients has recently been completed. The two year events are awaiting final CEC adjudication. ClinicalTrials.govIdentifier:NCT01874002. RESULTS The adjudicated two year clinical results of the REMEDEE Registry will be available at TCTCongress 2016. CONCLUSION The novel bio‐engineered COMBO stent shows promising one year clinical results. However, no longer follow‐up results are currently available. The 1000 all‐comers patient REMEDEE registry will provide insight into real world two year clinical outcome data.

AB: There is great unmet need in discovering novel treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) and identifying the new agents potentially causing drug‐induced parkinsonism. New indications and contraindications of drugs are typically approved following rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation. However, RCTs have their inherent limitations, since they are usually conducted in ideal conditions, with high cost and limited follow‐up periods. In the past decade, large cohort studies with long follow‐up outcome data was derived from a PD database in a real‐world setting. Studies based on real world data (RWD) can help to augment and extrapolate data obtained in RCTs and provide information about the safety and effectiveness of a medication in heterogeneous, large populations. In the present review, we focus on the published real world studies designed to develop new treatment strategies for repurposing drugs and identifying contraindications for PD. We also outline the challenges and limitations in these studies. Subsequently we introduce PaWei app platform, which hopefully can facilitate PD management and address real‐world problems associated with PD. Better understanding of RWD collection and analysis is needed if RWD is to achieve its full potential.

AB: Many pts with T2D on OADs eventually require basal insulin therapy. This post‐hoc analysis examined whether Gla‐300 could provide insulin‐naïve pts on OADs with reductions in prior OAD therapy without compromising impact on A1C, while preserving the hypoglycemia benefit of Gla‐300 vs. insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100). Pt‐level data from the randomized controlled EDITION 3 trial and de‐identified data from the Clinformatics real‐world claims database were analyzed. After initiating basal insulin, OAD use was reduced in the EDITION 3 study (49% pts used 2 OADs at baseline vs. 8% continuing at 6 months [mo] [N = 875]). Pts with a reduction in the use of OADs (2 OADs to 1 OAD) vs. those who remained on 2 OADs demonstrated significant and comparable A1C reduction 6 mo after initiating either Gla‐300 or Gla‐100, while preserving the relative protection from hypoglycemia previously demonstrated with Gla‐300 (Table). Consistent with these results, real‐world data also demonstrated a reduction in OAD use (39% of pts using 2 OADs at baseline vs. 23% at 6 mo [N = 6,430]) following Gla‐300 or Gla‐100 initiation, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia with Gla‐300 compared with Gla‐100. These data suggest that pts treated with Gla‐300 could step down OAD use without sacrificing glycemic control and with less hypoglycemia than with Gla‐100. (Table presented).

AB: Background‐The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended increased aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men ages 45 to 79 years and women ages 55 to 79 years for whom benefit outweighs risk. This study estimated the clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of a statewide public and health professional awareness campaign to increase regular aspirin use among the target population in Minnesota to reduce first CVD events. Methods and Results‐A state‐transition Markov model was developed, adopting a payer perspective and lifetime time horizon. The main outcomes of interest were quality‐adjusted life years, costs, and the number of CVD events averted among those without a prior CVD history. The model was based on real‐world data about campaign effectiveness from representative state‐specific aspirin use and event rates, and estimates from the scholarly literature. Implementation of a campaign was predicted to avert 9874 primary myocardial infarctions in men and 1223 primary ischemic strokes in women in the target population. Increased aspirin use was associated with as many as 7222 more major gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. The cost‐effectiveness analysis indicated cost‐saving results for both the male and female target populations. Conclusions‐Using current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, a state public and health professional awareness campaign would likely provide clinical benefit and be economically attractive. With clinician adjudication of individual benefit and risk, mechanisms can be made available that would facilitate achievement of aspirin's beneficial impact on lowering risk of primary CVD events, with minimization of adverse outcomes.

AB: Background. Shortening the duration of treatment with HCV direct‐acting antivirals (DAAs) leads to substantial cost reductions. According to the label, sofosbuvir and ledipasvir can be prescribed for 8 weeks (SL8) in noncirrhotic women or men with HCV genotype 1 and low viral loads. However, real‐world data about the efficacy and safety of SL8 are largely missing. Methods. Interim results from an ongoing prospective, multicenter cohort of 9 treatment centers in Germany (GECCO). All patients started on treatment with HCV DAAs since January 2014 were included. This report describes safety and efficacy outcomes in 210 patients with HCV monoinfection and 35 with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‐HCV coinfection given SL8 in a real‐world setting. Results. Of 1353 patients included into the GECCO cohort until December 2015, a total of 1287 had complete data sets for this analysis; 337 (26.2%) fulfilled the criteria for SL8 according to the package insert, but only 193 (57.2%) were eventually treated for 8 weeks. Another 52 patients did not fulfill the criteria but were treated for 8 weeks. SL8 was generally well tolerated. The overall sustained virologic response rate 12 weeks after the end of treatment was 93.5% (186 of 199). The on‐treatment response rate was 99.4% (159 of 160) in HCV‐monoinfected and 96.4% (27 of 28) in HIV‐HCV‐coinfected patients. Ten patients were lost to follow‐up. Conclusions. SL8 seems highly effective and safe in well‐selected HCV‐monoinfected and HIV‐HCV‐coinfected patients in a real‐world setting. Copyright © The Author 2016.

AB: Background: The results of the 5‐year overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has been reported rarely. The aim of the RENSUR5 registry study was to obtain real‐world data on the use of therapies in mRCC and assess 5‐year OS in Russian population. Methods: Patients were retrospectively identified at 11 cancer centers in different regions of Russia (Astrakhan, Barnaul, Ekaterinburg, Kazan, Krasnoyarsk, Obninsk, Omsk, Rostov‐on‐Don, Samara, St. Petersburg, Ufa). Patients were included if mRCC was diagnosed from January 2010 to January 2011. Anonymised data were collected through an online registry covering demographics, treatments and outcomes. Results: 439 adult mRCC patients were included in the study for analysis. Mean age at diagnosis of mRCC was 60.9 (33‐ 90) years (with 9% of patients aged >75 years). Patients were predominantly male (70.2%), 67.7% had nephrectomy; clear‐cell and non‐clear cell tumors were detected in 61.1% and 7.7% of patients, respectively. 271 (62%) patients received systemic therapy. Median duration of therapy was 11 months (95% CI 9.5‐12.5). The majority of treatment was with interferon only (n = 145). 105 (23.9%) patients were treated with targeted therapy. 69 (15.7%) patients received >1 treatment lines. Survival outcomes are listed in Table. Conclusions: RENSUR5 is a large 'realworld' database assessing mRCC treatment patterns and 5‐year OS in Russia. Based on first results of this study, we assume that 5‐year OS should be improved on novel therapies. (Table Presented) .

AB: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) can be classified as explanatory or pragmatic. Currently, explanatory and pragmatic are considered to be the extremes of a continuum: Many trials have some features of both explanatory and pragmatic RCTs. The Salford Chronic Obstructive Respiratory Disease (COPD) trial was an open‐label phase 3 RCT assessing an experimental product (fluticasone furoate‐vilanterol) vs usual care. The Salford investigators labelled it as "the world's first phase 3 pragmatic RCT" in COPD patients. The evaluation of the Salford trial by means of the PRECIS‐2 tool, yielded a mix of both extremes (explanatory and pragmatic) with several of the 9 domains close to the explanatory extreme and few to the pragmatic one. A number of the features could not be considered as being minimal changes over usual clinical practice. Hence, it would be difficult to accept that the Salford COPD trial was a pragmatic RCT. In addition, all trial participants could have been subject to the Hawthorne effect. The scientific community needs to be rigorous enough when using certain terms related to RCT. It is clear that the Salford COPD trial had particular features‐sharing some of explanatory phase 3 RCTs and some of pragmatic RCTs. This, however, is not enough to tag it as a "pragmatic" RCT providing "real‐world" data. These words should not be used when referring to prelicensed RCT, unless they really describe how was the trial conducted and the type of data gathered‐something that with the current clinical trial regulations will only occur in very rare circumstances.

AB: Background: The EpiNet project has been established to undertake investigator‐led clinical research in people with epilepsy. Randomised controlled trials in people with recently diagnosed epilepsy commenced in May 2015. Not all patients are willing to participate in formal trials, and trials cannot be run in all centres. Objective: To establish an international multi‐centre registry of patients who commence a first anti‐epileptic drug for newly diagnosed epilepsy. Material and methods: EpiNet investigators have been asked to register patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who start their first AED. They are asked why they commenced the particular drug, and to update the record whenever patients are seen again. Records are to be updated at least once per year. We want to know how patients respond to the AED; if they have further seizures, if the AED is changed to another drug, or a second AED is added, and why changes are made. This registry will serve as a 'real‐world' comparison for the EpiNet‐First randomised controlled trials. We have obtained patient and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, as necessary. Results: As of the beginning of May 2015, 147 patients had been entered into the First AED registry within the EpiNet database. This particular registry has only recently been commenced, and these comprise 2% of patients in the EpiNet database. We expect numbers to grow rapidly. Conclusion: The First AED registry will provide extremely valuable information about prescribing habits of neurologists and real‐world data regarding effectiveness of AEDs in recently diagnosed epilepsy. Neurologists who are not currently participating in EpiNet are welcome to join this project.

AB: Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignant disorder of plasma cells affecting primarily elderly patients, is the second most commonly diagnosed hematologic neoplasm. With the recent influx of effective new agents available, including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, targeted monoclonal antibodies, and now chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR‐T) therapy, the treatment landscape is evolving rapidly. Although the role of consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in first remission is well established, in the relapsed setting after upfront ASCT, the role of a second ASCT (SAT) following reinduction is less clear and understudied. Practice patterns vary significantly across institutions, and most of the literature available to guide clinical decisions consists of single‐institution experiences, with only 1 randomized study evaluating the role of SAT compared with a nontransplantation approach. SAT is likely underused, because it has not been included in clinical trials examining novel regimens for relapsed disease. Furthermore, outcomes likely can be improved with approaches to intensify the preparative regimen and the use of standard post‐transplantation maintenance. In this review, we examine the role of SAT in the current MM treatment landscape in the context of recent data on the efficacy of CAR‐T therapy in this disease. We caution the abandonment of SAT, given that CAR‐T therapy is in its infancy in MM treatment, and that real‐world data in the relapsed setting are consistently inferior to clinical trial outcomes.

AB: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) affects seriously physical and mental health of the patients. Studies show that acupuncture may be promising in treating POI, yet evidence is insufficient. International patient registry, one form of observational study, is designed for evaluating effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in real‐world clinical settings. We will face a series of opportunities and challenges. The opportunities are as follows: (1) Interdisciplinary cooperation can improve the effect of acupuncture for POI. (2) The protocol for acupuncture to treat POI has room for improvement. (3) The patient registry study can make up the shortcomings of randomized controlled trials. (4) The patient registry study can collect real‐world data and explore responses of different populations to acupuncture and can be the foundation for the successive studies. International patient registry may face technological, ethical and financial challenges, while the established International Patient Registry Platform of Acupuncture‐Moxibustion (www.amreg.org:8082/v3) is actively responding to these challenges. Till now there have been more than 300 patients of POI enrolled on this platform. Copyright © 2018

AB: The debate on the use and misuse of P values has risen and fallen throughout their almost century‐long existence in scientific discovery. Over the past few years, the debate has again received front‐page attention, particularly through the public reminder by the American Statistical Association on how P values should be used and interpreted. At the core of the issue lies a fault in the way that scientific evidence is dichotomized and research is subsequently reported, and this fault is exacerbated by researchers giving license to statistical models to do scientific inference. This paper highlights a different approach to handling the evidence collected during a randomized controlled trial, one that does not dichotomize, but rather reports the evidence collected. Through the use of a coin flipping experiment and reanalysis of real‐world data, the traditional approach of testing null hypothesis significance is contrasted with a Bayesian approach. This paper is meant to be understood by those who rely on statistical models to draw conclusions from data, but are not statisticians and may therefore not be able to grasp the debate that is primarily led by statisticians.

AB: Real‐world data on hypoglycemia rates are sparse and comparisons among insulin regimens rely heavily on data from randomized clinical trials, particularly in non‐western countries. The aim of the non‐interventional International Operations Hypoglycemia Assessment Tool (IO HAT) study conducted in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey and the UAE was to assess the incidence of hypoglycemia among patients with insulin‐treated (premix, short‐acting and long‐acting) diabetes. Baseline characteristics of patients with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are shown in Table 1. “Any” and “nocturnal” hypoglycemia rates, per patient‐year (PPY), were highest in patients with T1D on short‐acting regimens during retrospective and prospective periods (Any, 81.7 and 123.1; Nocturnal, 35.4 and 22.9 PPY). Rates of any and nocturnal hypoglycemia were lowest in patients with T2D on long‐acting regimens (Any, 13.9 and 24.0; Nocturnal, 4.2 and 2.5 PPY). In the pooled population of patients with T1D and T2D, there was a significantly lower (p<0.001) rate ratio (RR, [95% CI)] for any hypoglycemic event in patients using premix (RR 0.57 [0.50:0.64)], long‐acting (RR 0.39 [0.34:0.45)] or short‐ and long‐acting insulin (RR 0.70 [0.62:0.79)] compared to those using short‐acting insulin.

AB: Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and the rate of ischemic stroke attributed to non‐valvular AF is estimated at 5% per year. Several multi‐center studies established left atrial appendage closure as a safe and effective alternative to oral anticoagulation, but there is a need for additional real world data. Methods: The purpose of this observational, prospective, single‐arm, multicenter clinical study is to compile real‐world clinical outcome data for WATCHMANTM LAA (left atrial appendage) Closure Technology. One thousand subjects at up to 70 institutions in Europe, the Middle East, and Russia will be enrolled. Patients will be followed for 2 years after WATCHMAN implantation, according to standard medical practice. Primary endpoints include procedural and long‐term data including stroke/embolism, bleeding, and death. This article presents the background of the LAAC device and describes the design of the study. Results: Results for peri‐procedural analyses are expected toward the end of 2015; long‐term follow‐up data are expected in the latter half of 2017. Conclusion: The EWOLUTION study will formally expand knowledge of LAA closure into a broader real world setting. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB: Background: Recent studies have shown Regorafenib (R) and TAS‐102 (TAS) to be superior to placebo (P) in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, no studies have directly compared R with TAS. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of R compared with TAS using indirect comparison methods. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane database to identify published and unpublished studies up to November 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for patients with mCRC, involving Regorafenib or TAS‐102. Data including overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS) and toxicity (Tox) were extracted. Pairwise direct meta‐analyses (R vs. P and TAS vs. P) and indirect comparison (R vs. TAS) using network meta‐analyses methods (R package “netmeta”) to preserve randomization were performed. Results: 914 citations were initially identified among which 3 RCTs fulfilled eligibility criteria (CORRECT, CONCUR and TAS‐102) involving 1,764 patients (R: 641, TAS: 534, P: 589). Subgroups of patients (1,659) who had not received prior R or TAS were used to performed meta‐analyses for efficacy. Results of efficacy and toxicity are shown in table. Conclusions: In this indirect comparison, R and TAS appeared to have similar efficacy. However, R appears to have more toxicity compared to TAS. Post‐approval real world data focusing on the comparative toxicity of R and TAS is warranted. (Table Presented).

AB: For time‐to‐event data in a randomized clinical trial, we proposed two new methods for selecting an optimal treatment for a patient based on the covariate‐specific treatment effect curve, which is used to represent the clinical utility of a predictive biomarker. To select an optimal treatment for a patient with a specific biomarker value, we proposed pointwise confidence intervals for each covariate‐specific treatment effect curve and the difference between covariate‐specific treatment effect curves of two treatments. Furthermore, to select an optimal treatment for a future biomarker‐defined subpopulation of patients, we proposed confidence bands for each covariate‐specific treatment effect curve and the difference between each pair of covariate‐specific treatment effect curve over a fixed interval of biomarker values. We constructed the confidence bands based on a resampling technique. We also conducted simulation studies to evaluate finite‐sample properties of the proposed estimation methods. Finally, we illustrated the application of the proposed method in a real‐world data set. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

AB: Two experiments were conducted to investigate the use of computer graphics and cluster analysis in aiding human relational judgment. The experimental stimuli were similarity matrices from real‐world data sources. The experimental tasks required subjects to detect the number of clusters or to judge the similarity between a designated pair of objects in the displayed matrix. Each matrix was either ordered randomly or arranged according to the results of cluster analysis. In the first experiment each matrix was displayed in one of four schemes: number scheme, color scheme, size scheme, or three‐dimensional (3D) vertical line scheme. In the second experiment the matrices were displayed as 3D vertical lines with or without surface contour. The results indicated that the cluster‐ordered displays greatly facilitated cluster detection performance in all but the 3D line scheme. Matrix ordering had no effect on the value judgment task. The perceptual compatibility principle and theories of perceptual grouping provided predictions and were tested in this experiment. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved.

AB: We aimed to assess the validity of diagnostic codes relating to diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in real‐world data seeking to create a national DFU registry. Data were obtained from the diabetes registry of Maccabi Healthcare Service (MHS) a 2.1 million member sick fund in Israel, which included 122,500 patients in 2015. We randomly selected and reviewed ∼400 patient files from each of the following categories: 1.) had a diagnostic code of DFU in 2015; 2.) had a diagnostic code suggestive of DFU in 2015 including: leg ulcer, amputation, DFU in proximate years or abnormality reported by nurse; 3.) high risk patients (peripheral arterial disease (PAD), neuropathy, etc.). The patients' charts were reviewed by study physicians and DFU was validated or refuted. Relying upon diagnostic codes entered by physicians, the positive predictive value was 73.1% (95% CI 67.6‐78.2) and the sensitivity was 48.2% (95% CI 45.8‐50.7%). We therefore conclude that the diagnostic codes alone cannot be reliably used to create a DFU registry, and a prospective registry is considered. The estimated annual prevalence of DFU in the diabetes registry of MHS in 2015 was 1.3% (95% CI 1.0‐1.6%). Clinical features and outcomes of patients with validated diagnostic codes of DFU are shown (Table). In multivariate analysis: age, diabetes duration, socioeconomic status, previous amputation and PAD were independently associated with risk of amputation or death. (Table Presented).

AB: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the uncontested “gold standard” for establishing causation between a therapy and its outcomes, since they can guarantee that control and intervention subjects are similar in all the known and unknown attributes that might influence outcomes. RCTs use a rigorous experimental design with the primary goal of understanding the “average” overall benefit and risk of a standardized therapy in a selected group of patients. Yet even when an RCT demonstrates substantial net benefit for a specific therapy, its optimal role in routine clinical practice can remain unclear. Concerns frequently relate to how well the therapy might perform in different clinical settings and in broader patient populations than those studied in traditional RCTs. Observational studies can serve as a useful complement to RCTs, giving a deeper understanding of the long‐ term benefits and harms of a treatment in routine clinical practice, when administered to unselected populations. Real‐world data also help identify the subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from a treatment, or to suffer side effects. However, observational studies are often limited in their ability to account for confounding and bias due to patient selection. A rigorous methodological approach and the use of advanced statistical techniques can help reduce the risk of selection bias. When carefully applied, observational studies remain a reliable, often invaluable source for informing routine clinical practice.

AB: Background: Observational studies of new coronary stents are necessary to assess performance in a variety of complex patient and lesion types. Furthermore, the optimal dose and duration of thienopyridine treatment is unclear, particularly in patients with complex clinical conditions. The TAXUS Liberte Post‐Approval Study is designed to provide 5‐year data on the TAXUS Liberte paclitaxel‐eluting stent with concomitant prasugrel therapy in routine clinical practice and to contribute data to the DAPT study. Study Design: The TAXUS Liberte Post‐Approval Study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Enrollment of approximately 4,200 patients receiving >1 TAXUS Liberte stents is planned. All patients without a contraindication will be prescribed prasugrel plus aspirin for 1 year. The 12‐month primary end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction in on‐label stent patients will be compared with historical TAXUS Express stent data from the TAXUS ATLAS and TAXUS ARRIVE studies. Secondary clinical end points include stent thrombosis, all‐cause death, stroke, revascularization, and bleeding in all patients. In addition, this study will be the first to evaluate prasugrel use in a routine practice setting (including 5 and 10 mg daily doses) and will contribute data to the DAPT Study, comparing 12 versus 30 months of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug‐eluting stent placement. Summary: The TAXUS Liberte Post‐Approval Study will be the first to provide long‐term real‐world data on use of the TAXUS Liberte Stent with prasugrel treatment. The study is currently enrolling, and primary end point data are expected in mid 2013. 2012 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB: Background: Harvest of oral mucosa for urethroplasty due to urethral stricture is associated with donor‐site‐morbidity. We assessed functionality and safety of an authorized tissue‐engineered oral mucosa graft (TEOMG) under routine practice in stricture recurrences of any etiology, location, length and severity (real‐world data). Methods: 99 patients from eight centers with heterogenous urethroplasty experience levels were included in this prospective, non‐interventional observational study. Primary and secondary outcomes were success rate (SR) and safety at 12 and 24. months. Findings: All but one patient had >=. 1, 77.1% (64 of 83). >=. 2 and 31.3% (26 of 83). >=. 4 previous surgical treatments. Pre‐ and postoperative mean. +/‐. SD peak flow rate (Qmax) were 8.3. +/‐. 4.7. mL/s (n = 57) and 25.4. +/‐. 14.7. mL/s (n = 51). SR was 67.3% (95% CI 57.6‐77.0) at 12 and 58.2% (95% CI 47.7‐68.7) at 24. months (conservative Kaplan Meier assessment). SR ranged between 85.7% and 0% in case of high and low surgical experience. Simple proportions of 12‐month and 24‐month SR for evaluable patients in all centers were 70.8% (46 of 65) and 76.9% (30 of 39). Except for one patient, no oral adverse event was reported. Interpretations: TEOMG is safe and efficient in urethroplasty. Copyright © 2017.

AB: Background and Aims: In phase III registration trials, ritonavir boosted paritaprevir, with ombitasvir and dasabuvir (PrOD or Viekira Pak) +/‐ ribavirin was safe, well tolerated and had excellent efficacy with SVR12 rates >95%. However, real‐world data on the safety and efficacy of PrOD therapy in cirrhotic patients are limited. Recently, the FDA requested additional information to the drug label, warning of the possibility of liver injury in those with advanced liver disease. The REV1TAL study is the largest realworld study evaluating the safety and efficacy of PrOD therapy in cirrhotic patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection. Methods: Between October 2014 and July 2015, a compassionate access program supported by AbbVie Pty Ltd was conducted in Australia across 47 viral hepatitis treatment centers most of which were affiliated with the Australian Liver Association Clinical Research Network (ALA CRN). Patients were included if they received at least one dose of PrOD. The primary end‐points were SVR12 (HCV viral load<LLOQ at least 12 weeks post treatment) and drug discontinuation rates due to adverse events. Local physicians reported the frequency and nature of serious adverse events with particular focus on death, hepatic decompensation and grade 4 biochemical abnormalities observed within 3 months of completing therapy. Results: The program provided PrOD therapy to 582 adult patients with HCV genotype 1. The top 20 ALA CRN treating sites recruited approximately 500 patients, and complete data are available on 404 patients. The majority of patients had cirrhosis (74%) with genotype 1a (65%) infection. Baseline features of the fully characterized patients are shown in Table 1. In this interim analysis of 404 patients (74% cirrhosis, 9.3% CPB), the overall SVR12 was 96% (data complete in 85%). SVR12 rates were similar for cirrhotic and non‐cirrhotic patients (96.0% and 97.4%, respectively). Similar to previous reports, baseline viral load, MELD score and liver stiffness did not influence SVR. Early cessation of therapy occurred in 5.5% of patients and in these patients SVR12 was lower at 56%. Hyperbilirubinaemia on therapy was common, with nearly 5% of patients developing hyperbilirubinaemia > 100 mumol/L. Serious adverse effects are shown in Table 2. Conclusions: In a real‐world setting, treatment with PrOD in genotype 1 HCV infection achieves excellent SVR12 rates including those with cirrhosis. Hyperbilirubinaemia is a frequent ontreatment finding, but hepatic decompensation resulting in early cessation of therapy is rare. (Table Presented).

AB: The aim of this registry is to provide data on age‐related clinical features of suspected myocarditis and to create a study platform allowing for deriving diagnostic criteria and, at a later stage, testing therapeutic interventions in patients with myocarditis. Study design and results After an initial 6‐month pilot phase, MYKKE was opened in June 2014 as a prospective multicenter registry for patients from pediatric heart centers, university hospitals, and community hospitals with pediatric cardiology wards in Germany. Inclusion criteria consisted of age<18 years and hospitalization for suspected myocarditis as leading diagnosis at the discretion of the treating physician. By December 31, 2015, fifteen centers across Germany were actively participating and had enrolled 149 patients. Baseline data reveal 2 age peaks (<2 years, >12 years), show higher proportions of males, and document a high prevalence of severe disease courses in pediatric patients with suspected myocarditis. Severe clinical courses and early adverse events were more prevalent in younger patients and were related to severely impaired leftventricular ejection fraction at initial presentation. Summary MYKKE represents a multicenter registry and research platform for children and adolescents with suspected myocarditis that achieve steady recruitment and generate a wide range of real‐world data on clinical course, diagnostic workup, and treatment of this group of patients. The baseline data reveal the presence of 2 age peaks and provide important insights into the severity of disease in children with suspected myocarditis. In the future, MYKKE might facilitate interventional substudies by providing an established collaborating network using common diagnostic approaches. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB: BACKGROUND Randomized studies have shown that ticagrelor and prasugrel reduce thrombosis, albeit at an excess cost of bleeding, compared with clopidogrel. Nevertheless real‐world data indicate these drugs are used infrequently, suggesting that thrombotic and bleeding risks may differentially influence the use of novel P2Y12 inhibitors in contemporary practice. METHODS We studied 14,938 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at a single tertiary care center in New York (Mount Sinai). Patients were cross‐classified by both thrombotic risk (TR) and bleeding risk (BR) according to the PARIS risk scores, which categorizes patients as low, intermediate and high risk for each respective outcome. The frequency of novel P2Y12 inhibitors prescribed at discharge was tabulated across groups and compared using tests of trend. RESULTS The number (%) of patients at low, intermediate and high TR was 8309 (55.6%); 4239 (28.4%) and 2390 (16.0%), while the analogous calculations for bleeding were 5230 (35.0%); 6954 (46.6%); and 2754 (18.4%). Novel P2Y12 inhibitor prescription increased in a step‐wise fashion as TR increased whereas the opposite was observed for BR (Figure). Absolute differences in novel P2Y12 use were approximately 5% from lowest to highest risk within each TR group whereas the corresponding gradients across BR groups was larger (~ 14%). CONCLUSION Both thrombotic and bleeding risks, as calculated by the PARIS scores, influence use of novel P2Y12 inhibitors in a contemporary PCI population, although the effect of BR appears to be larger than for TR.

AB: We evaluated whether Nurse‐Family Partnership might serve as a cost‐effective social policy for improving health. Using data from studies of randomized controlled trials as well as real‐world data, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate cost‐effectiveness of Nurse‐Family Partnership in a hypothetical cohort of first‐born children in the United States. Analyses were conducted in 2015. Were all new mothers eligible for Nurse‐Family Partnership, the program would produce 0.11 QALYs (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.06, 0.17) at an additional cost of $1,021 (95% CI=‐$2,831, $4,414) per nurse‐visited child's lifetime relative to the comparison‐group children or $14,642 (95% CI = Savings, $71,877) per QALY gained. However, if applied to high‐risk mothers, it would generate 0.19 QALYs (95% CI = 0.09, 0.44) and a net benefit of $2,764 (95% CI =‐$1,210, $7,092) per nurse‐visited child. Nurse‐Family Partnership should be considered as a policy investment, particularly in an era of investments in the social determinants of health.

AB: The therapeutic management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is rapidly evolving. Following the positive results of pivotal large‐scale randomised trials, the non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent an important alternative to standard anticoagulation. In phase III studies, dabigatran was as effective as, and significantly safer than warfarin. Additional information on real‐world data of dabigatran is now warranted. RE‐COVERY DVT/PE is a multi‐centre, international, observational (i. e. non‐interventional) study enrolling patients with acute DVT and/or PE within 30 days after objective diagnosis. The study is designed with two phases. Phase 1 has a cross‐sectional design, enrolling approximately 6000 patients independently of treatment choice, with the aim of providing a contemporary picture of the management of VTE worldwide. Phase 2 has a prospective cohort design, with follow‐up of one year, enrolling 8000 patients treated with dabigatran or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) with the aim of comparing their safety, defined by the occurrence of major bleeding, and effectiveness, defined by the occurrence of symptomatic recurrent VTE. RE‐COVERY DVT/PE will complement both the results of other observational studies in this field and the results of phase III studies with dabigatran, in particular by assessing its clinical benefit in various patient subgroups treated in routine clinical practice.

AB: Non‐adherence is a major barrier to maximising the acute and long‐term effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia. Long‐acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics, which release active ingredient gradually (over a period of weeks) from a deep‐tissue injection, were developed to improve treatment adherence in schizophrenia, and thereby improve the long‐term outcome for patients. Measuring such benefits can be challenging, however, since randomised controlled trials generally increase adherence compared with clinical practice, leading to an underestimation of any potential difference in effectiveness between treatments. Consequently, individual randomised controlled trials and meta‐analyses have shown mixed results regarding the benefits of LAIs compared to oral antipsychotics, underscoring the relevance of appropriately considering design, population and treatment factors when interpreting these diverging results. Mirror image studies provide a better reflection of the real‐world impact of schizophrenia treatment. In a mirror image study, each patient acts as his/her own control: historical treatment with an oral antipsychotic is compared with prospective treatment with an LAI. Such studies strongly and consistently favour the use of LAIs over oral antipsychotics, revealing significantly reduced rates of treatment discontinuation, relapse, and hospitalisation with LAIs. Important emerging data suggest that continuous antipsychotic treatment may exert the biggest preventive effect on treatment discontinuation, relapse and rehospitalisation when provided early in the illness course, at a time when each single relapse is associated with the greatest loss in social, educational, vocational and, possibly, biological reserve and functioning. Taken together, these real‐world data indicate that appropriate use of LAIs early in the disease course is a valuable treatment option for patients with schizophrenia.

AB: BACKGROUND: Observational studies of new coronary stents are necessary to assess performance in a variety of complex patient and lesion types. Furthermore, the optimal dose and duration of thienopyridine treatment is unclear, particularly in patients with complex clinical conditions. The TAXUS Libertē Post‐Approval Study is designed to provide 5‐year data on the TAXUS Liberté paclitaxel‐eluting stent with concomitant prasugrel therapy in routine clinical practice and to contribute data to the DAPT study. STUDY DESIGN: The TAXUS Libertē Post‐Approval Study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Enrollment of approximately 4,200 patients receiving ≥1 TAXUS Liberté stents is planned. All patients without a contraindication will be prescribed prasugrel plus aspirin for 1 year. The 12‐month primary end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction in on‐label stent patients will be compared with historical TAXUS Express stent data from the TAXUS ATLAS and TAXUS ARRIVE studies. Secondary clinical end points include stent thrombosis, all‐cause death, stroke, revascularization, and bleeding in all patients. In addition, this study will be the first to evaluate prasugrel use in a routine practice setting (including 5 and 10 mg daily doses) and will contribute data to the DAPT Study, comparing 12 versus 30 months of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug‐eluting stent placement. SUMMARY: The TAXUS Libertē Post‐Approval Study will be the first to provide long‐term real‐world data on use of the TAXUS Liberté Stent with prasugrel treatment. The study is currently enrolling, and primary end point data are expected in mid 2013.

AB: The objective of this mini‐review is to discuss the role of real‐world studies as a source of clinical evidence when experimental studies, such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs), are not available. Waiting for RCT evidence when the technology is diffusing could be anti‐economical, inefficient from the policy perspective and methodologically questionable. We explain how real‐world studies could provide relevant evidence to decision makers. Matching techniques are discussed as a viable solution for bias reduction. We describe a case study concerning a cost‐effectiveness analysis based on real‐world data of a technology already in use: Mitraclip combined with medical therapy versus medical therapy alone in patients with moderate‐to‐severe mitral regurgitation. The CEA has encountered the scepticism of most reviewers, due not to the statistical methodology but to the fact that the study was observational and not experimental. Editors and reviewers converged in considering real‐world economic evaluations premature in the absence of a RCT, even if in the meantime the technology had been implanted >30 000 times. We believe there is a need to acknowledge the importance of real‐world studies, and engage the scientific community in the promotion and use of clinical evidence produced through observational studies.

AB: Objective: The aim of the Global SYMPLICITY Registry (GSR) is to collect real‐world data on the safety and efficacy of renal denervation (RDN) using either the original Symplicity FlexTM renal denervation catheter or the newer‐generation Symplicity SpyralTM catheter. Furthermore, a sub‐cohort of patients are receiving treatment of renal artery branch vessels in addition to the main renal artery. Design and Methods: The GSR is a prospective, multicentre, non‐randomised international registry of RDN enrolling up to 3000 patients with uncontrolled hyperten‐sion. Patients are followed at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Follow‐up data collected per routine care includes: clini‐cal assessment, office blood pressure measurement, 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement, blood tests, ECGs, renal artery imaging, and EQ‐5D quality of life questionnaire. At the time of CSANZ 2017 six‐month safety and efficacy data will be available for ∼2500 patients and 3‐year data will be available on ∼1750 patients. Moreover, data from post‐hoc analysis of ∼270 patients treated with the Symplicity Spyral catheter as well as data on ∼90 patients who had RDN treatment in both the main renal artery and branches will be available for presentation. Results and Conclusions: The Global SYMPLICITY Reg‐istry is the largest real world database of renal denervation therapy and has enrolled over 2500 patients to date. The registry also includes the largest dataset of renal artery branch treatment reported so far. All available follow‐up data informing on short and long‐term safety and efficacy of the Symplicity renal denervation system will be presented.

AB: Background. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has been considered the standard anticoagulant for patients with non‐ST‐segment‐elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS), yet it has limitations, including an unpredictable dose‐response and intravenous administration. Enoxaparin was shown to be more effective than UFH in two large, randomized trials, ESSENCE and TIMI 11B. These trials were conducted before the widespread use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, clopidogrel, and an early invasive management strategy, leaving questions concerning whether and how newer agents should be used in combination. Methods. The INTERACT trial compared the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin, relative to UFH, in high‐risk NSTE ACS patients receiving aspirin and the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor eptifibatide. The design and primary results of INTERACT are reviewed and compared with similar trials of combination therapy and with observational studies. Results. In INTERACT, enoxaparin was associated with significant reductions in recurrent ischemia during the first 4 days, death or myocardial infarction at 30 days, and non‐coronary artery bypass grafting‐related major bleeding at 4 days relative to UFH. Recent trials of enoxaparin in NSTE ACS patients have differed in the use of concomitant medications, the timing and frequency of invasive procedures, and end point definitions. The results from INTERACT are consistent with the results of ESSENCE and TIMI 11B and with "real‐world" data from the CRUSADE and GRACE registries. Conclusions.

AB: The paper discusses the use of randomized neural networks to learn a complete ordering between samples of heart‐rate variability data by relying solely on partial and subject‐dependent information concerning pairwise relations between samples. We confront two approaches, i.e. Extreme Learning Machines and Echo State Networks, assessing the effectiveness in exploiting hand‐engineered heart‐rate variability features versus using raw beat‐to‐beat sequential data. Additionally, we introduce a weight sharing architecture and a preference learning error function whose performance is compared with a standard architecture realizing pairwise ranking as a binary‐classification task. The models are evaluated on real‐world data from a mobile application realizing a guided breathing exercise, using a dataset of over 54 K exercising sessions. Results show how a randomized neural model processing information in its raw sequential form can outperform its vectorial counterpart, increasing accuracy in predicting the correct sample ordering by about 20%. Further, the experiments highlight the importance of using weight sharing architectures to learn smooth and generalizable complete orders induced by the preference relation.

AB: Background: MM is heterogeneous, with varying drivers of progression, prognosis and response. There is a need for tools to help physicians evaluate MM prognosis at first relapse. A novel risk‐stratification algorithm (RSA) was developed using real‐world data from the Czech Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG ‐ Development Cohort (DC)) for patients with relapsed MM initiating second‐line (2L) therapy. The RSA used 16 predictors from routine clinical practice to estimate risk scores: age; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; extramedullary disease; new bone lesions; refractory status; severe toxicities at first line; time to next treatment; serum β‐2 microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase at diagnosis and at relapse; bone marrow plasma cell count, thrombocyte count, calcium and albumin at relapse; cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis. Scores were used to stratify patients into four risk groups (1 (lowest risk) ‐ 4 (highest risk)), based on overall survival (OS) expectations. The RSA also provides a frailty and aggressiveness score to define drivers of risk. Aims: External validation of the RSA is needed to ensure replicability of results in external data sets that can vary in terms of treatment patterns and demographics. This analysis aimed to assess validity of the RSA in a realworld data set in Greece. Methods: To assess RSA validity, data from a single center registry between June 2000 to October 2017 were analyzed. All patients with MM initiating 2L treatment during this period were included. Data for one of the RSA predictors (new bone lesions at 1st relapse) were not available; bone lesion data were randomly assigned by applying the incidence of bone lesions observed in the DC. Missing values for other predictors were imputed five times using multiple imputation and the third imputation was selected for the base case analysis. A sensitivity analysis of five imputed data sets, pooled using Rubin's rules, and scenario analyses for the bone lesion data were performed. Results: Data from 232 patients were analyzed. Patient characteristics showed differences from the DC which resulted in different distribution of risk groups in the two data sets. The median OS from initiation of 2L was 62.3 months. Median OS was not reached in group 1 and median OS in groups 2‐4 was 74.9, 33.7 and 10.8 months, respectively. There was a clear discrimination of OS between the four risk groups; however, the confidence intervals (CIs) of the hazard ratios (HRs) overlapped (Figure 1). The frailty and aggressiveness scores across the four groups showed similar distribution to the DC, with a trend towards lower frailty‐driven risk and similar aggressiveness‐driven risk. The c‐index was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72‐0.82); a value in the range 0.7‐0.8 had been predetermined to identify accurate discriminative power. The R2 value for the Greek data was 0.43. Summary and Conclusions: The RSA was effective in quantifying risk and stratifying patients with relapsed MM, using long‐term follow‐up real‐world data from a single center. The analysis is limited by a small sample size and the need for imputation of missing values, which can result in wider CIs than expected. Given the uncertainty in all analyses comparing risk groups, the HRs estimated by Rubin's rules gave results consistent with the basecase analysis. The RSA could be used as stratification criteria in clinical trials for patients with relapsed MM. It may also help identify patient severity and drivers of risk to tailor management strategies, based on identifying both frailty and aggressiveness. (Table Presented) .

AB: Background and aims: Despite the efficacy of basal insulin therapy in individuals with T2DM, a significant number of patients may not achieve glycaemic goals. Patients taking basal insulin who reach their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) goal but not their glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target represent an important unmet T2DM management need. This study used both randomized clinical trial (RCT) and "real‐world" data to compare the baseline characteristics of T2DM patients with HbA1c > 7.0% achieving FPG levels < and >130 mg/dL. Materials and methods: Characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, and weight, of patients on basal insulin who do or do not achieve HbA1c < 7.0% were analysed using 11 pooled RCTs assessing insulin glargine (6‐months follow‐up) and real‐world data from the GE Centricity electronic medical records (EMR) database (6‐ and 12‐months follow‐up). Patients with HbA1c > 7.0% were stratified by FPG level (< 130 or > 130 mg/dL). Results: Patients with high HbA1c at follow‐up also had high baseline HbA1c (HbA1c > 7.0% vs < 7.0%: RCT, 9.1% vs 8.5%; EMR: 9.0% vs 8.1% [6‐months follow‐up] and 9.0% vs 8.0% [12‐months follow‐up]). About 50% of the RCT patients reached HbA1c goal vs < 30% of EMR patients. Of patients with HbA1c > 7%, about 50% (RCT) and < 30% (EMR) achieved FPG < 130 mg/ dL. RCT patients tended to be younger, less obese, and weigh less vs EMR patients (mean: age 2‐4 years younger; BMI ~3 kg/m2 less; and weight ~6 kg less). Patients with HbA1c < 7.0% were somewhat older than those with HbA1c > 7.0% (mean age in years for HbA1c < 7.0% vs > 7.0%: RCT, 58.4 vs 57.7; EMR, 62.3 vs 60.2 [6‐months follow‐up] and 62.7 vs 59.8 [12‐months follow‐up]). Little difference existed in gender distribution or mean BMI for patients with HbA1c < 7.0% versus HbA1c > 7.0%. For both RCT and EMR patients with HbA1c > 7.0%, those with FPG < 130 mg/dL were slightly older than those with FPG > 130 mg/dL (mean age for FPG < 130 vs > 130 mg/ dL: RCT, 58.7 vs 56.4 years; EMR, 62.3 vs 59.6 [6‐months follow‐up] and 62.4 vs 59.0 [12‐months follow‐up]). Differences were also seen in baseline insulin usage in the RCT patients, with more patients with FPG > 130 mg/ dL using a fast‐acting insulin analogue (71.2% vs 28.9%). For both RCT and EMR patients, other demographic characteristics did not differ between the FPG groups. Conclusion: We present differences in characteristics between patients on basal insulin who do or do not achieve HbA1c < 7.0%. Patients with a higher baseline HbA1c were less likely to achieve target HbA1c < 7.0% on basal insulin alone; more intensive treatment regimens may be required. A large proportion of the HbA1c > 7.0% patients were also above target for FPG at follow‐up and would likely benefit from addition basal insulin titration. In patients achieving FPG < 130 mg/dL, despite above target HbA1c values, postprandial glucose (PPG) control could be used to help bring their HbA1cwithin recommended limits. Appropriate therapeutic choices for those not reaching HbA1c < 7.0% should be based on assessment of FPG and PPG, as well as of HbA1c. A better understanding of patient characteristics and factors involved in goal achievement might increase the numbers of patients reaching targets and reduce the time they are exposed to hyperglycaemia and its adverse consequences.

AB: Background: Standard treatment for patients with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) consists of R‐CHOP‐21, established when two randomised trials did not find dose‐dense administration of R‐CHOP to be superior (Cunningham et.al 2013, Delarue et.al 2013). In both these trials, as well as in the majority of other clinical trials that provide the current evidence base for use of R‐CHOP‐21, 8 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 were administered. An exception is the MInT‐study, where 6 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 was associated with superior outcome to 6 cycles of CHOP‐21 for low‐risk patients aged <60 (Pfreundschuh et.al 2006). Despite a lack of solid evidence to support the use of 6 instead of 8 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 for all patients, administration of 6 cycles is commonly utilised in practice. Also, this strategy is supported by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (Tilly et.al 2015, Zelenetz et.al 2016). The NCCN guidelines motivate the use of 6 cycles for all patients partly by the increased toxicity in absence of clinical benefit seen on administration of 8 cycles compared to 6 cycles of dose‐dense R‐CHOP‐14 among patients aged 61‐80 in the RICOVER‐60 trial (Pfreundschuh et.al 2008). To our knowledge, no randomised trial has demonstrated superiority of 8 compared to 6 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21. As part of a current project on utilising real world data from the Danish and Swedish lymphoma registries to predict outcome in DLBCL, we examined whether patients treated with 6 or 8 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 had similar survival and could be analysed as a single group. Methods: The study population was identified through the Swedish and Danish Lymphoma Registries 2007‐2015. Patients with leptomeningeal‐, eye‐ or CNS involvement were excluded. Data was conditioned to reach 200 days overall survival to minimise the risk of immortal time bias. Multivariate cox regression analysis included number of chemotherapy cycles administered, age, Ann Arbor stage, performance status, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), gender and involvement of more than one extranodal site. Sensitivity analyses with patients stratified according to low or high risk, age >/≤70 and excluding patients treated with consolidative radiotherapy were performed. Results: During the time‐frame of this study, a total of 1200 adult patients received 6 or 8 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 in Sweden and Denmark. Of these, 1037 (86%) were administered 6 cycles, and 163 (14%) received 8 cycles. Mean age was 70 years (range 18‐91) in the cohort who received 6 cycles, and 68.5 years (range 25‐90) for patients treated with 8 cycles. Radiotherapy was administered to 121 (10%) patients. A larger proportion of patients who received 8 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 presented with Ann Arbor stage III‐IV, performance status >1, elevated levels of LDH and thus a higher IPIscore (Table 1). Conditional 5‐year overall survival rates were 73% in both treatment groups (Figure 1). No difference in outcome was detected for patients administered 6 versus 8 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.62‐1.20, p=0.36). Additionally, consistent results of no difference were observed in all patient subgroups stratified according to age (>/≤70), IPI (low/high) or no radiotherapy. Conclusion: Based on these real world data, we note that the majority of patients with DLBCL treated with R‐CHOP‐21 during the surveyed time period received 6 cycles, and conclude that the outcomes of patients treated with 6 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21 were non‐inferior to the outcomes of patients treated with 8 cycles of R‐CHOP‐21.

AB: Background: The NOAC trials showed a risk reduction of stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding in non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients treated with non‐vitamin K antagonists (NOAC) compared to warfarin. There are limited comparative real‐world data available for the NOAC. Purpose: The objective of this study is double: on the one hand to describe the baseline characteristics of patients treated with NAOC and on the other hand to asses effectiveness and safety of NOAC described as acute adverse cardiovascular outcomes: all‐cause mortality, bleeding and tromboembolic events: stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or cardioembolic), myocardial infarction, pulmonary and peripheral embolism. Methods: Prospective observational analysis of the Hospital reference population treated with NOAC for stroke prevention in non valvular atrial fibrillation since September 2013. Follow up at 6 months interval until July 2017, permanent discontinuation, switch of NOAC or dose, or death. 373 consecutive patients with AF and NOAC (Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Edoxaban) were included. We registered information into the baseline characteristics, CHADS2VASC2 score, HASBLED, type and dose of NOAC and adverse events. Results: Mean follow up 521 days. 44.8% women, mean age 75,18±11 years with 42% ≥80. CHA2DS2VASc score 3,9±1,6 and HASBLED 3,23±1,2. 13.9% were antiaggregated and 52,6% had glomerular filtration rate between 30‐79 mL/min/1.73 m2. The prevalence of the main comorbidities on initiation of NOAC treatment were: stroke 22.78% (n= 85), hypertension 80.16 % (N=299), diabetes 27.88% (n=104), vascular disease 16% (N= 60) and major bleeding 10,99% (N=41). The most used NOAC was Apixaban 51,8% (25,5% the 5 mgr dose and 26,3 % the 2,5 mgr) followed by 23,5% Dabigatran, 17,9% Rivaroxaban and 4,5% Edoxaban. Patients treated with Apixaban and Dabigatran had a significantly higher risk of embolism than those treated with Rivaroxaban in our series (Mean CHA2DS2VASc score 4,6 and 3,7 vs 3,2). Dabigatran 150 was preferentially prescribed in younger patients with mean HASBLED score =2. The most frequent NOAC used in patients with HASBLED score > 4 was Apixaban. The major bleeding rate was infrequent (N=14/3,75% for major bleeding and N=27/7.23% trivial bleeding) but higher for men than women (N=12 cases vs 2). 33 patients (8.8%) died: the main cause was cancer followed by sepsis and heart failure. No cases of pulmonary embolism or systemic embolism were observed. Stroke is infrequent (N=9) and related to history of previous stroke, elderly patients (>82 years) and CHA2DS2VASc punctuation between 5 and 7. Conclusions: Analyses of real‐world data can provide additional insights, complementing data from randomized clinical trials. Subgroup analyses (NOAC dosage, age, renal impairment, CHA2DS2‐VASc or HAS‐BLED score) show consistently lower risks of stroke/SE and major bleeding. Obtained data confirm the favourable risk benefit profile of NOAC in clinical practice.

AB: Background: A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of biosimilar therapies including SB4 (a biosimilar‐etanercept). However, real world data of the process of switching, acceptability to patients, efficacy and safety is lacking. Objectives: To obtain real world data of the acceptability and outcomes of patients with severe (eligible for TNFi therapy as defined by UK NICE) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who switch from bio‐original etanercept (boDMARD‐ETN) to the bsDMARD etanercept SB4 (bsDMARD‐ETN). Methods: Adult patients, with RA, PsA & AS, currently enrolled in the SMaRT study and switching from boDMARD‐ETN to bsDMARD‐ETN were followed for 6 months. Primary outcome was change in DAS28, PsARC response or BASDAI following switching. Additional outcomes included; % change of remission rate, HAQ‐DI, CRP or ESR levels, patient satisfaction, PDUS and SAEs leading to discontinuation. All patients had severe disease and were receiving boDMARDETN as per local guidelines of UK NICE. Analysis was performed in a similar way to a cross‐over RCT trial design where patients act as their own control with the experience in the 6 and 12 months prior to switching used as the control for experience after switching. Patient education and support during the switch included: rheumatologist face to face discussion, letter giving details of the switch and bsDMARD‐ETN information sheet, patients invited to discuss switch in clinic, helpline number with patients advised to call for further information or to report adverse events (AEs), routine review in clinic 3 months after switching, and then 6 monthly thereafter or more often if clinically necessary. Results: Following the education and support programme 99% of patients agreed to switch to bsDMARD‐ETN (one declined due to concerns about allergic reactions to previous therapies). To date 92 patients have switched from boDMARD‐ETN to bsDMARD‐ETN and been followed up for more than 6 months (58 RA, 15, AS, 16 PSA and 4 enteropathic arthritis; mean age 55.9 (14.9) yrs, (56 female, 36 male), mean disease duration 16.8 (10.9) yrs, duration on boDMARD‐ETN before switch mean 4.85 (3.92) yrs and duration since switch 204.1 (51.4) days. After 6 months following the switch 91% of patients using bsDMARD‐ETN have continued with mean last DAS28 ‐ 2.67 (1.32) for RA patients and mean last BASDAI ‐ 4.58 (2.47). Following the switch 8 patients stopped bsDMARD‐ETN after mean of 93.6 (56.4) days, the reasons for this were 7/8 clinician/patient determined inefficacy (6 returned to boDMARD‐ETN, 1 switched to certolizumab), 1/8 switched after reporting palpitations and poor concentration. In the control period 6 months before switching 17/110 patients stopped boDMARD‐ETN (85% continued) including 7 due to primary failure, 7 due to secondary failure, 1 adverse event (AE), 1 patient choice, 1 death (Lung cancer in male ex‐smoker with longstanding RA who had received boDMARD‐ETN for 10 yrs). Conclusions: An education programme prior to switching to a biosimilar TNFi leads to a high uptake by patients. In follow‐up of 6 months after switching from boDMARD‐ETN to a bsDMARD‐ETN there appears to be a low rate of discontinuation due to inefficacy or AEs.

AB: Background:A global named patient program (NPP) was opened in numerous countries worldwide in order to allow access to ibrutinib for eligible patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prior to approval in those countries. This program provides real‐world data on estimated outcomes with ibrutinib across a large, global CLL population. Aims: To use real‐world data from the ibrutinib CLL NPP to investigate whether treatment benefits reported in randomized clinical trials are reflected in outcomes observed in clinical practice. Methods: In an analysis of ibrutinib ordering/reordering, we estimated patient time on treatment in order to provide a conservative approximation of progression‐ free survival (PFS) using Kaplan‐Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression. Reordering data were censored at the date of last ibrutinib supply or resupply (ibrutinib was resupplied every 1‐3 months depending on stage of the NPP). Patients transferring to commercial ibrutinib after approval were censored at the time of NPP closure in their country. Results: Overall, 2908 patients with CLL from 30 countries participating in the global NPP were included in this analysis; median age was 69 years, and 66.3% were male. After 12 months, 77.3% (95% CI, 74.7‐79.6%) of the global population remained on treatment. This estimate is similar to the 12‐month time on treatment (81.5% [95% CI, 75.3‐86.3%]) and PFS (83.8% [95% CI, 77.8‐ 88.3%]) rates observed in the phase 3 RESONATETM study of ibrutinib for relapsed/refractory CLL (inclusion criteria were similar for the CLL NPP and the RESONATETM trial). Moreover, Kaplan‐Meier curves for time on treatment for the global CLL NPP population and the RESONATETM study were not statistically different (Figure 1A; CLL NPP versus RESONATETM: HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.86‐1.67]). Limited baseline demographic information collected at NPP enrollment allowed an exploration of time on treatment via multivariate analysis (Figure 1B). Younger patients or those achieving complete/partial response to prior therapy had significantly longer time on treatment. Strong trends indicating longer time on treatment were observed for patients who had received fewer prior lines of therapy, as well as for male patients, those who were diagnosed with CLL within the last 5 years, and those with a progression‐free interval of ≥3 months prior to ibrutinib treatment. Neither refractory disease (defined as no response to prior therapy [ie, stable disease or progression]) nor duration of response to prior therapy additionally impacted time on treatment. In total, 332 patients (11.4%) discontinued treatment during the observation period, the most common reasons being death (4.2%), disease progression (1.9%), and adverse events (1.7%). Summary/Conclusions: Although NPP data are based on physician declarations and are unmonitored, this analysis provides a real‐world estimate of time on treatment, which can be considered a conservative proxy for PFS. The estimates, determined from a large, global CLL population, were similar to those reported for RESONATETM, suggesting that results observed in ibrutinib clinical trials are reproducible in clinical practice.

AB: Background:A global named patient program (NPP) was opened in numerous countries worldwide in order to allow access to ibrutinib for eligible patients with relapsed/refractory mantle‐cell lymphoma (MCL) prior to approval in those countries. This program provides real‐world data on estimated outcomes with ibrutinib across a large, global MCL population. Aims: To use real‐world data from the ibrutinib MCL NPP to investigate whether treatment benefits reported in randomized clinical trials are reflected in outcomes observed in clinical practice. Methods: In an analysis of ibrutinib ordering/reordering, we estimated patient time on treatment, in order to provide a conservative approximation of progression‐ free survival (PFS) using Kaplan‐Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression. Reordering data were censored at the date of last ibrutinib supply or resupply (ibrutinib was resupplied every 1‐3 months depending on stage of the NPP). Patients transferring to commercial ibrutinib after approval were censored at the time of NPP closure in their country. Results: In total, 715 patients with MCL from 26 countries enrolled in the NPP were included in this analysis; median age was 70 years, and 76.1% were male. After 12 months, 52.3% (95% CI, 43.5‐60.4%) of the global population remained on treatment. This estimate is similar to the 12‐month time on treatment (57.6% [95% CI, 48.9‐65.3%]) and PFS (58.0% [95% CI, 49.3‐65.7%]) rates observed in the phase 3 RAY (MCL3001) study of ibrutinib for relapsed/refractory MCL (inclusion criteria were similar for the MCL NPP and RAY). Moreover, Kaplan‐Meier curves for time on treatment for the global MCL NPP population and the RAYstudy population were not statistically different (Figure 1; MCL NPP versus RAY: HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.83‐1.54]). Limited baseline demographic information collected at NPP enrollment allowed an exploration of time on treatment via multivariate analysis (Figure 2). (Table Presented) Timing of MCL diagnosis was the only independently significant variable in the multivariate analysis, with time on treatment being longer in patients diagnosed with MCL within the last 2 years. Of note, in this analysis, neither refractory disease (defined as no response to prior therapy [ie, stable disease or progression]), advanced disease (involvement of the bone marrow, extranodal sites, or both), relapsed disease, nor prior response with the previous therapy additionally impacted time on treatment. In total, 168 patients (23.5%) discontinued treatment during the observation period, the most common reasons being death (10.8%), disease progression (7.3%), and AEs (1.3%). Summary/Conclusions: Although NPP data are based on physician declarations and are unmonitored, this analysis provides a real‐world estimate of time on treatment, which can be considered a conservative proxy for PFS. The estimates, determined from a large, global MCL population, were similar to those for the RAY study, which suggests that results observed in MCL clinical trials with ibrutinib are reproducible in clinical practice.

AB: Background: The pivotal phase 2 PACE trial (NCT01207440) studied the use of ponatinib in adult patients with refractory Ph+ ALL and formed the basis of the approval of ponatinib. Prescribing data tracked by the specialty pharmacy exclusively responsible for distribution of ponatinib in the US are available from Jan 2014 onward. Aims: To compare the PACE clinical trial data vs real‐world pharmacy data, in order to examine similarities and differences between patient characteristics, regimens and duration of therapy evolving over time. Methods: We compared PACE data, which enrolled patients Sep 2010 ‐ Oct 2011 (all providing informed consent) to real‐world data for Ph+ ALL patients starting ponatinib treatment Jan 2014 ‐ Dec 2015. Real‐world data source includes referring physicians, pharmacy intake forms and dispensing records. Data on coprescribing were available for a small subset of patients. Patient characteristics and dosing were compared using non‐parametric tests; average daily dose was calculated, including therapy gaps as "zero" dose. Duration of therapy was assessed using Kaplan‐Meier techniques and proportional hazard regression. Results: PACE enrolled 32 Ph+ ALL patients; 274 US real‐world Ph+ ALL patients started treatment with ponatinib over a 2‐year period. Demographic characteristics of PACE vs real‐world patients, including age (median 61.5 vs 55.5 years; p=0.589) were similar. Most PACE patients were in their 3rd line of TKI therapy or later (19% 2nd, 44% 3rd and 38% 4th) while most real‐world patients appear to be in earlier lines of TKI (29% no prior TKI reported, 32% 2nd line, 24% 3rd, and 15% 4th) (p<0.001). All PACE patients received 45 mg/day of ponatinib as their initial dose; in the real‐world, 50% of patients initially received 45 mg/day of ponatinib, 41% received 30 mg/day and 9% 15 mg/day. Average dose was higher in PACE vs real‐world (39.1 vs 27.3 mg/day; p<0.001). PACE only permitted monotherapy ponatinib whereas combination therapy appears to be used in a portion of real‐world practice. Median time on therapy was 2.7 months in PACE vs 5.5 months in real‐world patients (p=0.004), and nearly 50% of real‐world patients remained on therapy after 6 months, vs<20% in PACE (Table). Summary/Conclusions: Real‐world Ph+ ALL patients appear to be demographically similar to those enrolled in PACE, but there is evidence of ponatinib use earlier (less prior TKI treatment) in real‐world patients. Starting dose in realworld reflects 50%<45 mg daily and subsequent lower dose intensity. Median duration of therapy was significantly longer for real‐world patients than for PACE, with nearly one‐half of real‐world patients remaining on therapy at 6 months. Longer median duration of therapy may be related to lower dose intensity, use in earlier therapy lines, and use of combination therapy in real‐world clinical practice. Further study of real‐world use of ponatinib in Ph+ ALL is needed. (Table Presented).

AB: Objective: Eslicarbazepine acetate is a third‐generation sodium channel blocker which has been licenced for use in adults with epilepsy since 2009‐12. It has recently obtained a European licence in children aged over 6 years with partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation. However, it has been used off label in this population since January 2015 in Ireland. Aim: We aim to undertake a retrospective audit of the medical records of children with epilepsy aged over 6 years to 18 years who attend 3 tertiary Paediatric Neurology services in Dublin and who were prescribed eslicarbazepine acetate between Jan 1st 2015 and Dec 31st 2016. We will outline treatment effectiveness (as measured by seizure freedomor percentage reduction in seizure frequency over a twelve month period) and treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, seizure increase or adverse events. Method: Real world data will be collected retrospectively from patient medical charts through ananonymous data collection tool. Descriptive methods of reporting will be used. A sample size of 35 children is anticipated. Results: Results will be available April 2017 and be presented at the EPNS 2017. Conclusion: The results of this study should provide an insight into the impact on seizure control and side effects experienced in a cohort of children with refractory epilepsy exposed to Eslicarbazepine in a Tertiary Irish Paediatric Neurology setting.

AB: Objectives: The occurrence of inhibitors that inactivate factor VIII activity is a major complication in Haemophilia A patients. The Multicenter Randomized Sippet Study by Peyvandi et al. (2016) shows that the incidence of inhibitors is higher for previously untreated patients receiving recombinant FVIII compared to those treated with plasmatic FVIII. This research aims to investigate the costs associated with treating a Haemophilia A patient with high‐titre inhibitors in Germany and Austria in order to quantify potential savings through the usage of plasmatic FVIII instead of recombinant FVIII. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed including guidelines, real world data and RCTs to identify the treatment regimen of Haemophilia A patients. A cost model was developed for Austria and Germany to estimate the costs of treating patients with high‐titre inhibitors. Results: The primary treatment approach for patients with inhibitors is the immune tolerance induction (ITI) where large quantities of factor VIII are infused for on average 2 years in order to eradicate the inhibitors. Our cost model showed that the average cost of ITI for a 2 years old patient is € 2 million in Germany and € 1.3 million in Austria. For a comparable patient without inhibitors, cost of prophylactic treatment during the same time is € 140.000 in Germany and € 90.000 in Austria. In 20% ‐ 40% of the patients, the inhibitor eradication through ITI fails and 3.8% ‐ 12.5% of the patients with successful ITI relapse. In those cases, lifelong treatment with expensive bypassing agents is necessary. Yearly cost of treatment can vary from € 250.000 (on‐demand) to € 3.7 million (prophylaxis) for an adult patient with inhibitors. Conclusions: The findings suggest that Haemophilia A patients developing high‐titre inhibitors bear higher treatment costs. Plasmatic FVIII is therefore deemed cost saving compared to recombinant FVIII due to the lower incidence of inhibitors in previously untreated Haemophilia A patients.

AB: Background: Medication adherence rates decline over time, especially after the first dispensing. Comparing adherence rates for medications that have been on the market for differing period of time may distort real differences in medication adherence. Other analysis factors such as minimum number of dispensing criteria and Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) adherence measures can also affect adherence measurement. Objectives: To use one real world example (rivaroxaban vs apixaban) in non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients to quantify the impact of adjusting for imbalances in follow‐up periods, minimum number of dispensing, and use of the PQA adherence measure. Methods: Using IMS Health Real‐World Data Adjudicated Claims and Truven MarketScan claims databases, we included adult patients with >=1 rivaroxaban or apixaban dispensing (index date), >=1 year of pre‐index eligibility, >=1 AF diagnosis pre‐index, newly initiated on oral anticoagulant therapy, and no valvular involvement. Adherence was evaluated using proportion of days covered (PDC) >=0.8 for cohorts with (1) unbalanced follow‐up (2) balanced follow‐up (by matching on month and year of followup since fill‐date) (3) >=2 rivaroxaban or apixaban dispensings and a balanced follow‐up, and using (4) the PQA adherence measure. Results: Rivaroxaban users had significantly longer mean (SD) follow‐up than apixaban (408 [300] versus 254 [196] days, respectively). While apixaban users appeared to be more adherent in unadjusted analyses, this finding was reversed after 1) adjusting for unbalanced follow‐up 2) excluding single‐time users; and 3) applying the PQA‐endorsed adherence measure (Figure). Similar results were found using the Truven databases. Conclusion: Comparisons of the adherence rates among medications need to account for the period of time each have been on the market, number of dispensing and PQA measures. Retrospective analyses of adherence that do not adjust for such differences could produce spurious findings. (Figure Presented).

AB: Objectives: Pre‐marketing authorisation estimates of survival are generally restricted to those observed directly in randomised clinical trials (RCTs). However, for regulatory and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) decision‐making a longer time horizon is often required than is studied in RCTs. Therefore, extrapolation is required to provide long‐term evidence of treatment effect. Registry data can provide evidence to support extrapolation of treatment effects. The aim of this work is to use real world data (RWD) and non‐linear regression models to evaluate long term survival. Methods: IPD was simulated from published survival curves of patients with MM in real world. Additionally, SEER‐Medicare registry data were combined with RCT data to estimate long‐term survival of patients with MM. Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, log‐logistic, log normal parametric survival models and a nonparametric model were fit to the RCT data, and used to extrapolate the data from 48 months to 72 months. A naive extrapolation was applied as well as extrapolation based on simulated IPD, summary data and SEER‐Medicare data. Adequacy of the models was assessed through comparisons of the log‐likelihood, whilst treatment effects were estimated using the restricted Area under the Curve (AUC). Reliability was assessed through visual inspection of the fit to the long‐term data. Results: Blending RCT and registry data allowed for reliable estimation of long term survival of patients with MM using a log‐logistic, lognormal model and non‐parametric model. The log‐logistic and lognormal model estimated long term survival with reduced uncertainty when including the SEER‐Medicare database compared to a naive extrapolation approach. Conclusions: The results showed that the use of the SEER‐Medicare registry decreased the uncertainty in long term prediction of overall survival in patients with MM. The use of registry data may be an acceptable approach for pharmaceutical companies, regulatory and HTA decision bodies for assessing long term survival of cancer treatments.

AB: Background Information: Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is based on evidence resulting from randomized clinical trials and observational studies. In oncology, progression free survival and overall survival are usually the major endpoints for assessing efficacy. Treatments are almost always compared using survival model (e.g. the semi‐parametric Cox model) adjusting for key prognostic factors. Inferences are therefore based upon adjusted treatment effects, expressed as adjusted hazard ratios and p‐values. However, non‐parametric Kaplan‐Meier unadjusted survival curves are still routinely displayed along with their unadjusted survival medians. Hence, in some situations, adjusted statistics could contradict the apparent results observed with unadjusted survival curves. A literature review was conducted to evaluate the added value of adjusted statistics compared to unadjusted ones, regarding treatment baseline imbalances and confounding bias, especially in Real‐World‐Data studies coping with growing HTA expectations. Discussion: Statistical methods are proposed in the literature [Nieto 1996] to adjust survival curves and provide adjusted difference in survival medians to match treatment effects estimated in a survival model accounting for potential confounders. A review of these methods along with their comparative merits and limitations will be presented. Applied literature on these methods seems to be rare since this kind of adjustment is only emerging. Thus, in application files, HTA do not systematically receive this adjusted information and make their decisions upon different sources of evidence which may be more or less inconsistent. Further discussion between methodologists, clinicians and Health Technology Assessors on this topic should be promoted so that trials and studies routinely provide key statistical results for making informed decisions. Finally, the authors' recommendations to support HTA appraisal are to provide adjusted graphical displays of survival curves and adjusted differences in addition to unadjusted survival medians.

AB: Objectives: Decision‐analytic models are commonly used when assessing costeffectiveness, but a pragmatic trial utilising real‐world electronic health records can offer detailed, long‐term follow‐up of healthcare costs at the individual level without the need for modelling. Here, we compare cost estimates derived from information collected 'alongside' a trial to costs estimates derived from models in the literature. Methods: We perform a systematic literature review to retrieve information on healthcare costs of PSA‐based systematic screening for prostate cancer estimated as part of published cost‐effectiveness models. In addition, we link and statistically analyse a set of national registers covering prescription medication reimbursements, inpatient care and outpatient care to produce healthcare‐cost estimates for men diagnosed with prostate‐cancer during a 14‐year follow‐up of the 80000+ men in a prostate‐cancer screening trial. Results: The findings concerning the healthcare costs associated with systematic PSA‐based screening vary in the literature. From our pragmatic trial‐based data, the average cumulative costs were estimated to be less than 1600 euros for men in the control arm and less than 1800 euros for men in the screening arm (two‐sided p‐value: < 0.05). Comparing costs from a pragmatic randomised trial to modelling‐based estimates of costs, the real‐world cost estimates were significantly lower than those reported in models in the literature (two‐sided p‐value: < 0.001). Conclusions: Although analysis of real‐world data may able to provide a useful supplement to results from modelling studies, the validity of such analysis should be assessed on a case‐by‐case basis. In addition, although analysis using decision‐analytic models may be an unavoidable fact of life, such analysis should also be assessed for validity on a case‐by‐case basis. Our results suggest that the way in which 'cost‐effectiveness' results from modelling studies are interpreted could benefit from more analysis of costs collected alongside large pragmatic clinical trials.

AB: Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 75% of primary liver cancers and is a major global health problem. For unresectable disease, Trans‐Arterial RadioEmbolization (TARE) may be an alternative to sorafenib in intermediate stage patients who failed chemo‐embolization or in advanced stage patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) with no extra‐hepatic spread and good liver function. These treatments are very expensive and in a resource‐limited healthcare system, their use should be carefully evaluated. We performed a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) to simulate an increased utilization of TARE in place of sorafenib for the treatment of intermediate‐advanced stage HCC in the Italian National healthcare setting. Methods: Patient level data were collected at three oncology centres in Italy. A 1‐to‐1 propensity score matching was performed to obtain two cohorts of patients, treated with TARE or sorafenib, with similar clinical characteristics in terms of Child‐Pugh score, number of nodules and PVT. A Markov model was developed to project costs associated to the matched cohorts on a lifetime horizon. Healthcare resource utilization was derived by commonly applied treatment protocols for TARE and sorafenib. Costs were obtained from DRGs reimbursement rates and official tariffs. Results: Considering 1,082 candidates for TARE or sorafenib per year, and scenarios at 1, 3 and 5‐years with reasonable increased uses of TARE (30%, 40% and 50%), the BI for the Italian Healthcare Service resulted 31,769,062 , 30,771,546 and 29,838,449 , respectively. Conclusions: TARE can be considered a valid and safe treatment option for patients with intermediate‐advanced HCC. Our study reveals a potential decrease in the Italian healthcare budget after the diffusion of the new medical device based therapy, thus supporting the economic sustainability at national level of radioembolization in comparison to sorafenib in the relevant population. Further RCTs and real world data will be able to provide additional information to confirm these conclusions.

AB: Objectives: Limited French real world data on Crohn's disease (CD) patients treated with biologics is available. This study aims to describe the profile of French adult CD patients treated with biologics, treatment patterns, disease management, and biologic dosing patterns. Methods: Two different sources of data reflecting clinical practice were used: a cross‐sectional survey (Patient Database Survey‐PDS) of 130 hospital‐based hepato‐gastroenterologists with data collected for CD patients treated by biologics between December 2015 and January 2016; an Electronic Medical Record(EMR) database with 100 office‐based gastroenterologists and data collected over 12 months up to January 2016 for CD patients treated with adalimumab. Results: 223 patients were identified in the EMR database: 45.3% were men, with a mean age of 40.1 years. 1,043 patients were identified through the PDS survey: 51.2% were men, with a mean age of 37.3 years, 20.2% were unemployed. 77.7% of PDS patients were on their first biologic (15.3% starting on biologic therapy), 22.3% in biologics failure (2nd line and above). 51.2% of patients suffered from severe CD before starting biologic therapy. 32.0% of PDS patients were severely impacted by CD in terms of quality of life(QoL), more so for biologic failure patients. Infliximab was the most commonly used biologic across treatment lines, followed by adalimumab and vedolizumab. Utilization rates of the higher recommended maintenance dose in PDS patients were 26.0% with infliximab, 21.6% with adalimumab, 41.5% with vedolizumab, and 15.7% with adalimumab for EMR patients. Average time to switching between different biologics is 50.0 months between 1st and 2nd biologic, 94.8 months between 1st and 3rd biologic. Conclusions: CD is a burdensome disease for the patient, with a high percentage of patients having severely impaired QoL; utilization of the higher recommended maintenance dose indicates that currently available biologics may be insufficient for long term control of the disease.

AB: Objectives: The objective of our study was to evaluate the economic impact of targeted therapies for the treatment of clear cell metastatic RCC in Canada using real‐world data through the Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis). Methods: The Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) database was used to select the cohort of advances RCC collected prospectively over 15 centers of 6 Canadian provinces. Patients who had a diagnosis of RCC and metastatic RCC after January 1st 2011 were included.The database was used to describe the healthcare utilization of targeted therapies over the advanced phase of the disease and to estimate the associated cost. Unit costs of targeted therapies were pulled from the RAMQ list of medications. Results: The cohort study consisted of 675 patients with advanced RCC. 38% of patients had a nephrectomy in addition to targeted therapies and 19% had a metastasectomy. The cost of targeted therapy per patient for a median follow‐up of 23 months was $55,986. Using 2 lines of therapies cost in average $83,314 per patient for a median follow‐up of 25 months. Few patients received 3 lines of treatment; this leads to an additional cost of $16,764, totalling an average of $100,078 per patient. We observed a decrease in the number of patients throughout the treatment lines. 366 patients had one treatment line, 132 had two treatment lines and 33 patients had three treatment lines.85% of patients received Sunitinib, 23.3% Everolimus, 21.6% Pazopanib and 11.5% were treated with Axitinib. Patients receiving a first‐line targeted therapy were on treatment for a median of 10.5 months, 7.1 months for second‐line therapy and 4.6 months for third line. 36% of patients progressed to a second‐line treatment, and 9 %received a third line treatment. Conclusions: The findings of this study might inform decisionmakers concerning budget planning and funding to provide health care services.

AB: Objectives: Productivity losses in cardiovascular patients can be substantial, however few studies to date provided European estimates and methodologies used vary greatly. Our study will describe productivity losses and associated costs in European patients, during the first year after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), congestive heart failure (CHF) or stroke. Methods: Twelve European countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom participated in this cross‐sectional survey. Design is based on literature review and experts' recommendations to increase representativeness and minimize selection and recall bias; a validated questionnaire is used to ensure accurate assessment of productivity losses. Results: In each country, three large centers from different regions were selected to recruit 100 patients, evenly balanced among centers and events' types (study size N= 1,200). Eligible participants were: hospitalized for any incident ACS, CHF or stroke 3‐12 months ago, on lipid modifying therapy at index hospitalization and back at paid work for > 4 weeks. Patients are recruited during a routine follow‐up visit to a cardiologist or neurologist. Patients were evenly sampled in their 4th to 6th or 7th to 12th month post‐event. Health‐related productivity loss (absenteeism, presenteeism, unpaid work substitution) in the previous 4 weeks and duration of index hospitalization and sick‐leave are captured via the Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iMTA PCQ). Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are collected in a physician questionnaire. All screened patients are registered in a logbook. Valuation of lost hours into annual costs is done using the standard country‐specific salary (human capital or friction cost method). Center recruitment is ongoing, with data collection planned during Q3‐Q4 2016 and results dissemination in early 2017. Conclusion: Results will provide large‐scale, representative, real‐world data to characterize the individual and society burden of cardiovascular events across Europe, with local indirect costs suitable for economic modelling.

AB: Background: Real‐world data exploring effectiveness of treatments following demonstrated efficacy in phase III trials are becoming increasingly important, especially for regulatory bodies and payers. Pooling outcome and adverse‐event (AE) data from non‐interventional studies enables more accurate estimation of real‐world effectiveness and safety in clinically important subgroups. Methods: Individual pt data from pts receiving first‐line BEV + PAC with no additional chemotherapy agent for HER2‐negative mBC in three non‐interventional studies (ML21165 [Germany], AVANTI [Germany] and AVAREG [Hungary]) were extracted and pooled. Progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated in the BEV + PAC population and subgroups of clinical interest by Kaplan‐Meier methodology. Safety was analysed descriptively. Results: The analysis population included 2135 pts. The median duration of follow‐up was 13.1 (range <0.1‐54.7) months. The median BEV treatment duration was 5.4 (range <0.1‐45) months; 205 pts (10%) received BEV for >1 year. Treatment was stopped because of disease progression/death in 42% of pts and AEs in 7%. Median PFS and OS were 8.7 and 21.0 months, respectively, and varied according to established risk factors (table). There were no relevant differences in the incidence of grade >3 hypertension in pts with ECOG PS 2 (1.3%) vs 0/1 (2.4%) and age >70 (3.1%) vs <70 (2.4%) years. The exposure‐adjusted incidence of hypertension was 0.847 vs 0.653 events/pt‐year in pts >70 vs <70 years, respectively. Conclusions: Results from >2000 pts treated in the real‐world setting indicate effectiveness of first‐line BEV + PAC in HER2‐negative mBC. The main limitation of this analysis is the inconsistent data collection and recording between studies. Nevertheless, this approach provides insight into effectiveness of BEV + PAC in the real‐world setting. (Table Presented).

AB: Objectives: Lenvatinib (Lenvima) and sorafenib (Nexavar) are the two most recently FDA‐approved drugs for treating radioiodine (RAI)‐refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Both demonstrated superior progression‐free survival over placebo in their respective phase III clinical trials. In this study, we compared the cost‐effectiveness of the two treatments and placebo in treating RAI‐refractory DTC in the U.S. from a societal perspective. Methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and health benefits for treatment of RAI‐refractory DTC. Transition probabilities were from two phase‐III trials‐the SELECT trial comparing lenvatinib to placebo, and the DECISION trial comparing sorafenib to placebo. We used a bi‐monthly cycle length for a lifetime time horizon. We adjusted the survival rates based on comparisons of the two placebo groups in two trials. Direct medical costs and utility data were obtained from Redbook, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Medicare Fee Schedule, and published literature. All costs were adjusted to 2015 USD, discounted at 3% annually. One‐way probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: In the base case, placebo was most costly ($851,256), followed by lenvatinib ($197,374), and sorafenib ($164,371). Placebo was dominated, being the most costly and least effective treatment. High costs of placebo were driven by costs associated with palliative care. At a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, lenvatinib was the most cost‐effective option at $79,118/QALY gained compared with sorafenib. The treatment decisions were found to be sensitive to the treatment costs of lenvatinib and sorafenib, and the health utility of continuing with lenvatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Given a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, lenvatinib is the most cost‐effective treatment, compared with sorafenib and placebo. This finding supports the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommending tyrosine‐kinase inhibitors for RAI‐refractory DTC. Future research efforts should focus on updating results with real‐world data and directly comparing the two treatments.

AB: Objectives: Recently, long‐term treatment effects of GA and interferons‐β (IFNs) observed in the UK multiple sclerosis Risk Sharing Scheme (RSS) have become available. Using a UK National Health Service perspective, we evaluated the costeffectiveness of GA for RRMS using either randomised controlled trial (RCT) or RSS data. Methods: A discrete Markov model comparing GA (20 mg qd or 40 mg tiw) to BSC, IFN‐1a 44μg, IFN‐1a 22μg, IFN‐1a 30μg and IFN‐1b was developed. The model has 21 health states defined by Expanded Disability Status Scale and a 50‐year time horizon. It also incorporates adverse events, treatment discontinuation, various second‐line treatments and neutralising antibodies. Relapse rates and disability progression transition probabilities were obtained from natural history studies in RRMS patients. Treatment effects were informed by a de novo network metaanalysis using results of RCTs and outputs were compared to a scenario in which real‐world data from the RSS was used. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: GA dominated IFN‐1a 22μg and IFN‐1a 30μg as it represented lower overall costs and QALY gains of 0.226 and 0.067, respectively. GA is cost‐effective compared to BSC at an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,789 per QALY gained. Albeit a reversed ICER was observed, GA remained cost‐effective against IFN‐1a 44μg and IFN‐1b. The model was most sensitive to the treatment‐specific hazard ratio (HR) for disability progression. Other influential factors included the proportion of patients switching to second‐line treatments, discount rates, treatment waning and health‐state costs. Scenario analyses using treatment‐specific HR from the RSS confirmed the robustness of the base case findings and compared well with the 6‐year RSS results. Conclusions: Different modelling approaches and data sources consistently show that GA is a cost‐effective option for treating RRMS. GA was shown to be more effective than predicted at the outset of the RSS.

AB: The Swedish vascular registry, Swedvasc, was created in 1987 as a regional registry and achieved national coverage in 1994. This article describes how the registry developed during those 31 years. The aims of the registry were to enhance quality improvement and research within the field of vascular surgery. The registry was validated on several occasions and in 2015 an independent international validation took place, showing both excellent external (no missing cases) and internal validity (comparing the variables in the registry with case records). The Swedvasc was instrumental in the creation of Vascunet in 1997, the international collaboration of vascular registries in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Enabling international comparisons of indications, techniques and outcomes has proven to be a great force in quality improvement. This collaboration is now turning global, including the North American registry the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (SVS‐VQI) and hopefully soon also including the Japanese registry. The Swedvasc is used as an integral part of routine healthcare and over 100,000 procedures are registered annually. This provides clinicians, clinics, health authorities and researchers with real‐world data from an unselected nationwide population. Registry data have been used to describe patterns of treatment and outcomes over time and for monitoring quality of care locally, nationally and internationally and for quality improvement projects. The clinical data available in Swedvasc provide an important source not only for assessment and development of healthcare but also for research and over 100 original articles based on Swedvasc data have been published. A randomization module has been included in the registry since 2014 and opens up a new clinical trial paradigm; registry‐based randomized clinical trials. Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).

AB: Background: Since the establishment of clinical trial registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov the number of such registries and the volume of data within the registries has quadrupled. Many studies have assessed the clinical trial landscape within their research field and have been hindered by inadequate search queries. Several approaches within these studies have implemented descriptive statistical analysis by examining specific indications or by searching for trials often using vague search terms such as "neoplasms". This type of analysis permits the integration of potentially non‐relevant noisy data which, impairs the overall analysis quality, Methods: In this study, we developed a semantic ontology linking algorithm to comprehensively merge 16 trial registries, 198,000 clinical trials, 10,000 molecules from multiple drug databases and PubMed, thus rendering and identifying indications, treatment, sites and investigators into one resource. The method allowed for a semantically cleaned and collapsed database to be queried more effectively with higher reliability in results. Results: The second proponent of our study was to assess the international oncology trial landscape over the last 10 years. The last major analysis in 2009 identified a significant preference for United States clinical sites in large cancer trials. Since this study, oncology has evolved toward a precision therapy approach and adaptive design model. This 2017 analysis shows an increasing concentration of US based clinical activity. For lung cancer trials with a US component, the top 100 US clinical research sites in the US are involved in 86% of the phase 1 trials, representing 55% of the total enrolment. When analyzing site usage for phase 3, this share drops to 67% of trials, representing just 8,5% of the total patient enrolment targets. Conclusions: The semantic ontology and algorithms and exploiting real‐world data to mapped out and re‐evaluate the status of cancer trials globally and gave insights into how cancer trials are progressing in the future. Understanding this evolution is of high importance for clinical trial planning and global trial country and site optimization.

AB: Objective: The aim of the Global SYMPLICITY Registry (GSR) is to collect real‐world data on the safety and efficacy of renal denervation (RDN) using either the original Symplicity Flex (TM) renal denervation catheter or the newergeneration Symplicity Spyral (TM) catheter, which applies radiofrequency energy circumferentially to each renal artery quadrant simultaneously.Furthermore, following newer understanding of the renal anatomy, a sub‐cohort of patients are receiving treatment of renal artery branch vessels in addition to the main renal artery. Design and method: The GSR is a prospective, multi‐centre, non‐randomized international registry of RDN enrolling up to 3000 patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Patients are followed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Follow up data collected per routine care includes: clinical assessment, office blood pressure measurement, 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement, blood tests, ECGs, renal artery imaging, and EQ‐5D quality of life questionnaire. At the time of ESH 2017 six month safety and efficacy data will be available for ∼2500 patients and 3‐year data will be available on ∼1750 patients. Moreover, data from post‐hoc analysis of ∼270 patients treated with the Symplicity Spyral catheter as well as data on ∼90 patients who had RDN treatment in both the main renal artery and branches will be available for presentation. Results: The Global SYMPLICITY Registry is the largest real world database of renal denervation therapy and has enrolled over 2500 patients to date. The registry also includes the largest dataset of renal artery branch treatment reported so far. All available follow‐up data informing on short and long‐term safety and efficacy of the Symplicity renal denervation system will be presented. Conclusions: These data supplement the randomized and sham‐controlled SPYRAL HTN‐ON MED and OFF MED trials evaluating safety and efficacy of renal denervation performed in the main renal artery and branch vessels in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB: Background: Platinum‐based systemic chemotherapy is considered the backbone for management of advanced urothelial carcinomas. However there is a lack of real world data on the use of such chemotherapy regimens, on patient profiles and on management after treatment failure. Methods: Fifty‐one randomly selected physicians from 4 European countries registered 218 consecutive patients in progression or relapse following a first platinum‐based chemotherapy. Patient characteristics, tumor history and treatment regimens, as well as the considerations of physicians on the management of urothelial carcinoma were recorded. Results: A systemic platinum‐based regimen had been administered as the initial chemotherapy in 216 patients: 15 in the neoadjuvant setting, 61 in adjuvant therapy conditions, 137 in first‐line advanced setting and 3 in other conditions. Of these patients, 76 (35 %) were initially considered as cisplatin‐unfit, mainly because of renal impairment (52 patients). After platinum failure, renal impairment was observed in 44 % of patients, ECOG Performance Status > 2 in 17 %, hemoglobinemia < 10 g/dL in 16 %, hepatic metastases in 13 %. 80 % of these patients received further anticancer therapy. Immediately after failure of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, most subsequent anticancer treatments were chemotherapy doublets (35/58), whereas after therapy failure in the advanced setting most patients receiving further anticancer drugs were treated with a single agent (80/114). After first progression to chemotherapy, treatment decisions were mainly driven by Performance Status and prior response to chemotherapy (>30 % patients). The most frequent all‐settings second anticancer therapy regimen was vinflunine (70 % of single‐agent and 42 % of all subsequent treatments), the main reasons evoked by physicians (>1 out of 4) being survival benefit, safety and phase III evidence. Conclusion: In this daily practice experience, a majority of patients with urothelial carcinoma previously treated with a platinum‐based therapy received a second chemotherapy regimen, most often a single agent after an initial chemotherapy in the advanced setting and preferably a cytotoxic combination after a neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Performance Status and prior response to chemotherapy were the main drivers of further treatment decisions. Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

AB: Background: Cardiac ReSynchronization therapy (CRT) is an important intervention in heart failure. Objective: We sought to compare complication rates between randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of CRT with 'real world' complication rates reported in registries and administrative claims databases. Methods: PUBMED search to identify all relevant publications on CRT. Studies were classified into (RCTs) and registry studies. Percentages of individual complications were computed relative to sample sizes of various studies. Differences between groups were compared with Chi square test. Results: We identified a total of six RCTs, two administrative claims database studies and four CRT registry studies. RCTs included a total of 4,442 patients and 'real world' studies a total of 72,554 patients. Overall rates of procedural complications with CRT were significantly higher in RCTs compared to real world (8.12% vs 6.9%, p=0.002). Lead complications were higher in the real world studies compared to RCTs (11.3% vs 6.5%, p =0.0001). This could represent a follow up bias with patients in registries being followed for longer duration that would compound lead complication rates. Interestingly, RCTs had a higher incidence of pocket hematomas (2.04% vs 0.41%, p=0.001), likely due to under reporting of hematomas in administrative claims. Other procedural complications were similar between RCTs and real world data (Figure). Conclusion: Real world procedural complication rates of CRT appear to be significantly lower than those reported in RCTs. This could represent improved procedural techniques and better operator training with the evolution of CRT as mainstream treatment for HF. (Table presented).

AB: Background: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 3 (GT3) is more challenging compared with other genotypes. Since 2014, several new treatment regimens have been approved but sometimes based on limited data. Aim: To validate the use, effectiveness and safety of anti‐viral treatment in chronic hepatitis C genotype 3 infection under real‐word conditions. Methods: The German Hepatitis C‐Registry is a large national non‐interventional real‐world study for patients with chronic hepatitis C. A total of 1322 GT3 patients were enrolled (211 untreated and 1111 treated patients). Results: Between February 2014 and September 2015, five different treatment strategies have been used (PegIFN+RBV, PegIFN+RBV+SOF, SOF+RBV, DCV+SOF+/‐RBV, LDV/SOF+/‐RBV). Treatment uptake and use of treatment concepts changed markedly and rapidly during the study influenced by new approvals, guideline recommendations, and label updates. PegIFN‐based therapies constantly declined while DCV‐based therapies increased with one interruption after the approval of LDV/SOF, which was frequently used until new guidelines recommended not using this combination for GT3. Per‐protocol SVR ranged from 80.9% in the PegIFN+RBV group to 96.1% in PegIFN+RBV+SOF treated patients. Treatment‐experienced patients with cirrhosis showed a suboptimal SVR of 68% for SOF+RBV but a high SVR of 90‐95% for DCV+SOF+/‐RBV. The safety analysis showed more adverse events and a stronger decline of haemoglobin for RBV containing regimens. Conclusions: Real‐world data can validate the effectiveness and safety for treatment regimens that had previously been approved with limited data, in particular for specific subgroups of patients. The present study demonstrates how rapid new scientific data, new treatment guidelines, new drug approvals and label changes are implemented into routine clinical practice today.

AB: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost‐effectiveness of duloxetine versus routine treatment in management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). Two hundred thirty‐three patients with DPNP who completed a 12‐week, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized, multicenter duloxetine trial were re‐randomized into a 52‐week, open‐label trial of duloxetine 60 mg twice daily versus routine treatment. Routine treatment included pain management therapies. Effectiveness was measured by using the bodily pain domain (BP) of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF‐36). Costs were analyzed from 3 perspectives: third party payer (direct medical costs), employer (direct and indirect medical costs), and societal (patient's out‐of‐pocket costs and total medical costs). Costs of study medications were not included because of limited data. Bootstrap method was applied to calculate statistical inference of the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER). Routine treatment most frequently used included gabapentin (56%), venlafaxine (36%), and amitripytline (15%). From employer and societal perspectives, duloxetine was cost‐effective (ICER= ‐342 dollars and ‐429 dollars, respectively, per unit of SF‐36 BP; both P <or= .03) and the dominant therapy compared with routine DPNP treatment (both P < .05). From payer perspective, duloxetine trended toward cost‐effectiveness (ICER= ‐249 dollars per unit of SF‐36 BP; P <or= .06). These results, however, reflect the controlled environment of a clinical trial. An analysis of real‐world data would be beneficial. PERSPECTIVE: Evaluation of the cost and benefit of new pharmacologic treatments is highly desired by decision makers. From both employer perspective and societal perspective (including patient's out‐of‐pocket costs), this study demonstrated that duloxetine was more cost‐effective than routine treatment in management of DPNP.

AB: Background: Front‐of‐pack nutrition labelling may support healthier packaged food purchases. Australia has adopted a novel Health Star Rating (HSR) system, but the legitimacy of this choice is unknown. Objective: To define the effects of different formats of front‐of‐pack labelling on the healthiness of food purchases and consumer perceptions. Design: Individuals were assigned at random to access one of four different formats of nutrition labelling—HSR, multiple traffic light labels (MTL), daily intake guides (DIG), recommendations/warnings (WARN)—or control (the nutrition information panel, NIP). Participants accessed nutrition information by using a smartphone application to scan the bar‐codes of packaged foods, while shopping. The primary outcome was healthiness defined by the mean transformed nutrient profile score of packaged foods that were purchased over four weeks. Results: The 1578 participants, mean age 38 years, 84% female recorded purchases of 148,727 evaluable food items. The mean healthiness of the purchases in the HSR group was non‐inferior to MTL, DIG, or WARN (all p < 0.001 at 2% non‐inferiority margin). When compared to the NIP control, there was no difference in the mean healthiness of purchases for HSR, MTL, or DIG (all p > 0.07), but WARN resulted in healthier packaged food purchases (mean difference 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.72; p = 0.04). HSR was perceived by participants as more useful than DIG, and easier to understand than MTL or DIG (all p < 0.05). Participants also reported the HSR to be easier to understand, and the HSR and MTL to be more useful, than NIP (all p < 0.03). Conclusions: These real‐world data align with experimental findings and provide support for the policy choice of HSR. Recommendation/warning labels warrant further exploration, as they may be a stronger driver of healthy food purchases.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Real‐world treatment and outcomes in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) after platinum therapy are largely unknown. In light of emerging therapies, a retrospective chart review was conducted in France to characterize the experiences of patients with R/M SCCHN who have been previously treated with a platinum‐based regimen. METHODS: Real‐world data were collected through a chart review. Included were patients randomly selected from all adults aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with SCCHN at treating sites between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014 to meet an a priori sample‐size calculation. Patients were followed through August 20, 2016 or until death. Clinical trial participants were excluded. Demographics and treatment data were analyzed descriptively. Overall survival (OS) was quantified using Kaplan‐Meier analysis censoring for date of chart abstraction in surviving patients. RESULTS: Twenty‐three oncologists contributed data for a random selection of 204 patients; 86% were men and 97% were current or former tobacco users. The mean (SD) age was 63 (10.5) years at initial R/M SCCHN diagnosis. Most patients (89%) were treated first‐line with a platinum‐based regimen, and 117 (65%) of these patients progressed to second‐line treatment. Second‐line treatment among these 117 patients consisted largely of monotherapy with a taxane (33%), cetuximab (21%), or methotrexate (12%) irrespective of disease stage (ie, IVC vs non‐IVC), and 98 (84%) patients were identified as being second‐line platinum‐refractory (ie, did not receive second‐line platinum). Among those receiving second‐line treatment, median OS from first‐line initiation was 14.6 (95% CI: 13.0, 16.3) months. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients in this chart review received second‐line treatment following first‐line platinum‐based therapy, but median survival remained well under 1.5 years. This study highlights the need for more effective treatments for a patient population with a significant level of unmet need.

AB: Objectives: This study aimed at assessing the feasibility and long‐term efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in a "real world" setting. Background: Although LAAO has recently emerged as an alternative to oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation for the prevention of thromboembolic stroke, "real world" data about the procedure with different devices are lacking. Methods: Eight centers in the United Kingdom contributed to a retrospective registry for LAAO procedures undertaken between July 2009 and November 2014. Results: A total of 371 patients (72.9 +/‐ 8.3 years old, 88.9% males) were enrolled. The overall procedure success was 92.5%, with major events in 3.5% of cases. The device choice was Watchman in 63% of cases, Amplatzer Cardiac Plug in 34.7%, Lariat in 1.7%, and Coherex WaveCrest in 0.6%. A significant improvement in procedure success (from 89.2% to 95.7%; P = 0.018) and reduction of acute major complications (from 6.5% to 0.5%; P = 0.001) were observed between procedures in the first and the second half of the recruitment time. An annual 90.1% relative risk reduction (RRR) for ischemic stroke, an 87.2% thromboembolic events RRR, and a 92.9% major bleeding RRR were observed, if compared with the predicted annual risks based on CHADS2, CHA2DS2‐Vasc, and HAS‐BLED scores, respectively, over a follow‐up period of 24.7 +/‐ 16.07 months. Conclusions: LAAO can be performed safely in a real world setting with good implant success rates and procedural outcomes. The long‐term benefits of the procedure are reassuring in terms of both ischemic events and avoidance of severe bleeding associated with anticoagulation in this patient group. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB: BACKGROUND: There are limited long‐term, 'real‐world' data on ustekinumab, or the effect of dose adjustment in suboptimal responders. OBJECTIVES: We describe 52‐week data from TRANSIT, which initiated ustekinumab by licensed regimen and investigated exploratory dose adjustment. METHODS: Patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis and inadequate methotrexate response received ustekinumab, with immediate or gradual methotrexate withdrawal. Outcomes were similar between treatment arms at week 12 (primary endpoint), so week 52 data were pooled. Patients weighing ≤ 100 kg or > 100 kg were administered ustekinumab 45 or 90 mg, respectively. Patients weighing ≤ 100 kg without 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) response at weeks 28 or 40 received a dose adjustment to 90 mg. The primary analysis used observed data. RESULTS: Overall, 391 and 98 patients received ustekinumab 45 and 90 mg, respectively. Forty‐four patients (9%) discontinued before week 52 (0·4% due to adverse events). At week 52 (in the overall population), 369 patients (83%) achieved a PASI score ≤ 5, and 341 patients (77%) achieved PASI 75; the median PASI score decreased from 15 at baseline to 1·8. At weeks 28 and 40, 84 and 31 patients, respectively, did not achieve PASI 75 and received a dose adjustment; by week 52, 35/82 (43%) and 15/31 (48%) of these patients, respectively, achieved PASI 75 (two discontinued between weeks 28 and 40). CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab showed sustained 1‐year efficacy and was well tolerated when initially administered according to label. Adjusting the ustekinumab dose to 90 mg may result in clinically meaningful improvement in response in patients weighing ≤ 100 kg with suboptimal initial response.

AB: Aims: A randomized trial has documented that structured nurse‐led Atrial Fibrillation (AF) service is superior to conventional AF service, but there is a need for more data, confirming feasibility and outcome in a real‐world setting. We compared patient outcome in nurse‐led structured hospital AF clinics between realworld patients from Denmark (DK) and from the randomised trial on efficacy of a nurse‐led AF clinic reported from the Netherlands (NL), with respect to a composite outcome of CV hospitalization and CV death. Methods: Real‐world data consisted of baseline and follow‐up data. All patients were referred by cardiologists. The AF nurse specialist provided patient education, risk factor control, and stimulated empowerment and compliance in these patients. During follow‐up treatment was adjusted according to clinical guidelines, supervised by a cardiologist. Patient education was repeated and compliance was controlled. The study size was powered as a non‐inferiority study. Outcome measures were adjudicated by same principles in both countries. Results: 596 patients from DK and 356 patients from NL were included. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age, body mass index, type of AF, CHA2DS2VASc score and co‐morbidity. The composite primary end point occurred with an incidence rate of 8.0 in DK and 8.3 per 100 person years in NL, crude HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.56‐1.23). Adjustment for covariates and medical treatment did not substantially change HR. Conclusion: Structured nurse‐led hospital based AF service is feasible and effective, and patient outcome is in real life hospital based structured AF service is as least as good as in the setting of a randomized trial.

AB: Background: Adherence to oral anticoagulant (OAC) agents is important for patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) to prevent potentially severe adverse events. Objectives: To compare real‐world adherence rates for rivaroxaban vs other oral anticoagulant agents (apixaban, dabigatran, and warfarin) among patients with NVAF using claims‐based data. Methods: Healthcare claims from the IMS Health Real‐World Data Adjudicated Claims database (01/2011‐06/2015) were used to assess 6 month adherence rates defined as the percentage of patients with proportion of days covered (PDC) >=0.8 and >=0.9. Patients were included if they had >=2 dispensings of rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin at least 180 days apart (the first was termed as the index date), had > 60 days of supply, had >= 6 months of pre‐index eligibility, had >= 1 AF diagnosis preindex or at index date, and without valvular involvement. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate adherence to therapy adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, insurance type, index month and year, previous OAC use, and mental‐health risk factors for non‐adherence (e.g., mental disorders, bipolar). Results: A total of 13,645 rivaroxaban, 6,304 apixaban, 3,360 dabigatran, and 13,366 warfarin patients were identified. A significantly higher proportion of rivaroxaban users were adherent to therapy (PDC >= 0.8 at 6 months vs apixaban, dabigatran, and warfarin users; Table). After adjustment, the proportion of patients adherent to therapy remained significantly higher for rivaroxaban users vs apixaban (absolute difference [AD]: 5.8%), dabigatran (AD: 9.5%), and warfarin users (AD: 13.6%; all P<0.001; Table). More pronounced differences were found with a PDC >=0.9 (Table). Conclusion: Among NVAF patients, rivaroxaban was associated with significantly higher adherence rates relative to other OACs, whether using a PDC of >=0.8 or >=0.9, which could translate into improved patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.

AB: INTRODUCTION: The CAnadian women wiTh Uterine fibroids [UF] REgistry (CAPTURE) is the first registry worldwide designed to collect real‐world data about UF burden, management, and outcomes. METHODS: This is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study intending to enroll 1000 premenopausal adult women with symptomatic UF at >12 Canadian clinical practice sites. Women will be followed up to 2 years. RESULTS: The first 461 women enrolled in CAPTURE had a mean age of 43.3 +/‐ 6.9 years and BMI of 26.4 +/‐ 6.2 kg/m2. At the baseline visit, patients were most interested in treatment options (69.4%), obtaining information (54.7%), and gaining symptom control (50.8%). 16.3% of women were interested in maintaining fertility and 10.6% wanted to get pregnant. In the 3 months prior to baseline visit, 60.0% had been treated with medication for UF‐related symptoms; the most frequent were ulipristal acetate (53.4%), iron (43.6%), nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatories (25.1%), tranexamic acid (18.9%), and combined hormonal contraceptives (12.0%). At baseline, 21.2% of women had previously undergone UF‐related procedural intervention(s); myomectomy (46.5%) and uterine artery embolization (13%) were most common. Time since prior procedural intervention was <1 year for 17.3%, 1 to <3 years for 23.6%, 3 to <5 years for 21.3%, and >5 years for 37.8%. CONCLUSIONS: To date, data have indicated that Canadian women referred for treatment of symptomatic UF have varying expectations for management of UF. Many women had a history of medical and procedural intervention(s) for UF.

AB: Background and aims: Insulin glargine U300 (Gla‐300) is a new formulation of insulin glargine and is available in Germany and Austria since 2015. We investigated the clinical profile of Gla‐300 in adult patients with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the first year of treatment. Methods: Adult (≥18 years) patients with T1D/T2D and treated with Gla‐300 for at least 1 year included in the diabetes patient follow‐up registry (DPV) or the diabetes care evaluation initiative (DIVE) were investigated. The clinical efficacy (HbA1c, BMI and total insulin dose per kg) and safety (proportion of ≥1 severe hypoglycaemia) of Gla‐300 in the last six months prior to Gla‐300 initiation (Q0) and in quarters 1‐4 (Q1‐Q4) were compared. Results: A total of 476 patients with T1D and 1,157 patients with T2D were studied (median age 51.4 years and 65.4 years, respectively; diabetes duration 15.6 and years, respectively). During Gla‐300‐treatment mean HbA1c decreased from 8.0% to 7.8% in T1D and from 7.9% to 7.4% in T2D (unadj. p < 0.001). BMI increased in T1D (27.2 to 27.4 kg/m2, p = 0.039), but did not change in T2D. Insulin dose increased in T1D (0.43 to 0.47 IU/kg, p = 0.008) and in T2D (0.34 to 0.37 IU/kg, p < 0.001). No significant difference in the proportion of ≥1 severe hypoglycaemia during Gla‐300‐therapy was found in T1D/T2D. Conclusions: Results of real‐world data match to those of prior randomized clinical trials and show that Gla‐300 presents an effective and safe option for the treatment of patients with T1D and T2D.

DOI: 10.1002/pds.3838
AB: Background: Unmeasured confounding limits nonrandomized studies and may be amplified by some methods. Objectives: To determine whether confounding amplification (if predictable, as suggested by recent research) can be used to estimate unmeasured confounding. Methods: A method is described using two propensity score models identical but for one added variable or set of variables that generate confounding amplification. Unmeasured confounding (except that due to the variable(s) added) can then be estimated by extrapolation backwards. The observed change in the treatment effect estimate between the models is adjusted for the change in confounding due to increased balance in the added variable(s) (as estimated by an added variable(s)‐outcome regression coefficient and the Bross equation), and divided by the degree of confounding amplification expected, as predicted by 1R2 from linear probability propensity score models. This estimate and the original confounding due to the added variable(s) prior to its inclusion is subtracted from the smaller model's treatment effect estimate to yield an unconfounded estimate. Numerous uncertainties exist, however, including the predictability of confounding amplification in real‐world data, the accuracy of the estimates of confounding due to the added variable(s), and the estimation of confidence intervals (although bootstrapping suggests itself). Results: The method is shown to provide the correct unconfounded treatment effect estimate for several hypothetical scenarios. When applied to two published analyses supplying some, but not all, of the information needed, the method provides a qualitative indication of the general size and direction of residual confounding that is generally consistent with estimates of confounding suggested by comparisons to randomized trials. Conclusions: This method may provide a new approach to estimating unconfounded treatment effects, including potentially when instrumental variables do not exist. Its performance, however, has not yet been validated. Research involving simulation and realworld data is needed, given the need for overall validation and to examine if specific uncertainties about aspects of the method affect its performance in certain situations.

DOI: 10.1111/epi.14612
AB: Purpose: Perampanel is approved for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondarily generalised seizures (SGS), and primary generalised tonic‐clonic seizures in epilepsy patients aged ≥12 years. Approval of perampanel for partial seizures was based on three randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, Phase III Studies 304 (NCT00699972), 305 (NCT00699582) and 306 (NCT00700310); patients completing these could enter open‐label extension (OLEx) Study 307 (NCT00735397). Here, we report efficacy of perampanel as adjunctive treatment of SGS by co‐administration of enzyme‐inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) versus non‐EIAEDs in both the Phase III and OLEx studies. Method: In the double‐blind studies, patients (≥12 years) with partial seizures, with or without SGS, receiving 1‐3 AEDs at Baseline were randomised to placebo or 2‐12 mg/ day perampanel for 19 weeks. In the OLEx, patients received ≤12 mg/day perampanel for ≤272 weeks. Efficacy assessments included median percent change in SGS frequency/ 28 days, SGS 50% and 75% responder and seizurefreedom rates. Results: For patients with SGS at pre‐perampanel Baseline, 564 were in the double‐blind studies, and 388 received perampanel for ≥1 year in the OLEx. In the double‐ blind studies, perampanel co‐administered with an EIAED (carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin) had reduced efficacy compared with non‐ EIAEDs due to increased clearance; this was particularly evident at higher doses, although these differences were still greater than placebo. In the OLEx, concomitant administration of both non‐EIAEDs and EIAEDs was associated with sustained efficacy, with slightly better efficacy during the first, second and third years of perampanel exposure for non‐EIAEDs compared with EIAEDs. Conclusion: Perampanel demonstrated good and sustained long‐term efficacy against SGS. With the recent FDA approval of perampanel for monotherapy use for partial seizures, non‐EIAED data may be more relevant for consideration if perampanel is used as a single agent (no other AED) while real‐world data and experience are accumulated.

AB: Background and aims: To describe real‐world management of Parkinson's disease (PD) with dopaminergic treatments and the influence of routinely used management strategies on clinical outcomes. The study was also part of a European Medicines Agency risk‐management plan for the nonergoline dopamine agonist (DA) rotigotine, focusing on cardiovalvular fibrosis. Methods: SP0854 (NCT00599339) was a prospective, multicentre (10 countries), non‐interventional postauthorisation safety study of rotigotine and other dopaminergics, conducted under standard medical practice. Patients requiring either monotherapy (rotigotine/other DAs/levodopa), or levodopa in combination with rotigotine/other DA, were included and followed for <=33 months. Baseline intended patient‐ratio: 5:2:2:5:2 for "rotigotine", "other DA", "levodopa", "levodopa+rotigotine", "levodopa+other DA". Treatment modifications were allowed according to patients' needs. Primary safety objective: evaluation of cardiovalvular fibrosis. Primary efficacy variable: change from baseline in UPDRS‐III (motor), assessed by treatment received at a particular postbaseline visit. Results: 1531/2195 (69.7%) patients completed the study. Discontinuation reasons: lost to follow‐up (221;10.1%), consent withdrawn (137;6.2%), adverse events ([AEs] 79;3.6%), other (179;8.2%). Demographics/disease characteristics: Table 1. 5 (0.2%) patients experienced AEs of structural cardiovalvular pathology: Table 2. Overall AEs: Table 2. Mean UPDRS‐III score numerically improved when assessed by treatment received at Month 15, and in most treatments received at Month 33 (Figure 1). Conclusion: This study reports real‐world data from >2000 PD patients receiving dopaminergic treatment for up to 3 years. Few patients (5) experienced AEs of structural cardiovalvular pathology; none were considered causallyrelated to rotigotine, and no new safety signal was observed. UPDRS results suggest adequate control of motor symptoms with dopaminergic treatment over time. Funding: UCB Pharma.

AB: Background and aims: New oral disease modifying therapies (oDMT) for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are available. The aim was to assess patient adherence to oDMT: dimethylfumarate (DMF) and teriflunomide (TE) in comparison with classic injectable therapies (iDMT). Methods: RRMS patients switched from iDMT (interferon‐beta‐1a/1b/glatiramer acetate) to new oDMT between June 2015 and March 2016 in Hospital Alvaro Cunqueiro were recruited. Adherence, measured by medication possession ratio (MPR) and expressed in%, was compared for oDMT versus iDMT. Adherent patient was considered if MPR>=90%. Results: 38 patients were swittched from iDMT to DMF (n=20) or TE (n=18). Women: 87.8%, mean age (+/‐SD): 39.2+/‐8.5years; mean disease duration: 6.0+/‐5.0 years; median EDSS (range): 2[0‐6.5]; annualized relapse rate (ARR): 0.7+/‐0.8. 66.7% patients were switched from interferon‐beta and 33.3% from GA. Prior mean treatment duration (SD): 423.4+/‐167.2 days. The main reasons for change were inefficacy (59.4%) and intolerance (40.6%). 5 patients stopped oDMT (1 patient due to pregnancy, 3 patients due to GIintolerance and 1 due to lymphopenia). Mean oDMT duration: 166.5+/‐59.3 days. MPR to iDMT=85.2% vs. MPR to oDMT=98.1% (p> 0.001). No MPR differences between oDMT were observed. iDMT adherence among patients who switched to TE was 83.4% and 85.7% in patients switched to DMF (p<0.05). Adherence <80% was observed in 70% of patients on iDMT and in 100% on oDMT. Conclusion: Patients on oDMT present better adherence than those previously treated with iDMT. These changes may have an important impact on disease control. More real‐world data are necessary to evaluate long‐term adherence to oDMT.

AB: Objectives: Although it is essential to adjust confounding factors in real‐world data analyses, they are often not available. If they could be predicted from the administrative healthcare data, which usually contains a large sample size, analyses adjusted by the predicted factors will be useful. We developed a prediction model of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) using health insurance claims data. Methods: Clinical data (2008‐2017) of DPC hospitals, which include health insurance claims and HbA1c data, were used. Among 213,870 patients diagnosed with type‐2 diabetes, those having HbA1c value measured after the diagnosis were extracted. Logarithmic value of HbA1c was used as an explained variable to develop a model. Explanatory variables were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in statistical machine learning from age, sex, year, logarithmic value of cost for each of 26 categories such as first visit fee, surgery costs and injection drug costs, dummy variables for diagnoses, and dummy variables for antidiabetic drugs. The information was randomly divided into training data and validation data for developing the predictive model. Logarithmic values of HbA1c before and after dietary consulting were predicted using the model. Results: In 150,088 patients extracted, HbA1c data totaled 1,728,605. Most important variable based on LASSO was human insulins and analogues, followed by sulphonylurea antidiabetics, biguanide antidiabetics, logarithmic value of cost for home health, and DPP‐4 inhibitor antidiabetics. Mean values of HbA1c before and after dietary consulting were predicted as 6.96 and 6.93, and that of measured values were 7.85 and 6.89. Conclusions: We developed a prediction model and confirmed the similarity of predicted and measured value after dietary consulting. The measured value before consulting was higher than the predicted value, suggesting patients taking dietary consulting had higher HbA1c than those having similar attribute by the amount of the reduction by consulting.

AB: Introduction: Outcomes for lung cancer patients in the UK appear to be worse than comparable healthcare systems and whilst late presentation is an important contributor, variability in radical treatment rates, in particular surgery in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be important. Evidence from the National Lung Cancer Audit and the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons shows that the number of curative resections is increasing, but there is debate about whether this is appropriate and whether in some cases resection rates may be too high. Methods: Using data from the National Lung Cancer Audit (England only, 2008 2011 inclusive) we have looked at all cases of stage I and II NSCLC (confirmed and presumed). We have allocated every patient to a trust based on the recorded “place first seen” and divided the trusts into quintiles according to their resection rates in this group of patients. We excluded organisations with <25 cases (Stage I/II) in the study period (some private hospitals and nonacute specialist trusts, also where PCT had been recorded rather than acute trust). The resection rate quintiles were used in a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, stage, sex, PS, deprivation and co‐morbidity to assess the influence of resection rate on survival. Results: The table shows the results for Stage I/II combined. There was a statistically significant trend towards increased survival with a higher trust resection rate. Conclusion: In patients with Stage I and Stage II NSCLC, higher resection rate is associated with longer median survival, 1 year survival and 3 year survival. This improved survival is independent of variation in case‐mix factors. This real world data, whilst lacking the rigour of a randomised controlled trial, lends support to the hypothesis that lung cancer survival in the UK would increase if a larger proportion of patients underwent surgical resection.

AB: BACKGROUND: Front‐of‐pack nutrition labelling may support healthier packaged food purchases. Australia has adopted a novel Health Star Rating (HSR) system, but the legitimacy of this choice is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of different formats of front‐of‐pack labelling on the healthiness of food purchases and consumer perceptions. DESIGN: Individuals were assigned at random to access one of four different formats of nutrition labelling‐HSR, multiple traffic light labels (MTL), daily intake guides (DIG), recommendations/warnings (WARN)‐or control (the nutrition information panel, NIP). Participants accessed nutrition information by using a smartphone application to scan the bar‐codes of packaged foods, while shopping. The primary outcome was healthiness defined by the mean transformed nutrient profile score of packaged foods that were purchased over four weeks. RESULTS: The 1578 participants, mean age 38 years, 84% female recorded purchases of 148,727 evaluable food items. The mean healthiness of the purchases in the HSR group was non‐inferior to MTL, DIG, or WARN (all p < 0.001 at 2% non‐inferiority margin). When compared to the NIP control, there was no difference in the mean healthiness of purchases for HSR, MTL, or DIG (all p > 0.07), but WARN resulted in healthier packaged food purchases (mean difference 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.72; p = 0.04). HSR was perceived by participants as more useful than DIG, and easier to understand than MTL or DIG (all p < 0.05). Participants also reported the HSR to be easier to understand, and the HSR and MTL to be more useful, than NIP (all p < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These real‐world data align with experimental findings and provide support for the policy choice of HSR. Recommendation/warning labels warrant further exploration, as they may be a stronger driver of healthy food purchases.

AB: Background: In chronic hepatitis C virus‐infected patients cirrhosis is associated with less effective INF‐based treatment and higher risk of complications. New IFN‐free direct‐acting antiviral therapies have greatly improved sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in patients with cirrhosis, nonetheless the rates are still lower than in patients without cirrhosis. objeCtives: To assess the real world effectiveness of treatment with OBV/PTV/r ± DSV in patients with HCV infection and compensated cirrhosis participating in Polish public drug program. Methods: Registry that included patients with cirrhosis treated with OBV/PTV/r ± DSV, who entered the drug program from Oct 1 2015 to Jan 31 2016 in seven non‐randomly selected hospitals (N= 265). Data on genotype, comorbidities, past treatment, end of treatment response, SVR24 and reason for early treatment cessation (including AE) was collected retrospectively. Results: From 265 patients with cirrhosis receiving treatment (ITT population) 263 completed treatment (2 fatalities) and 256 had SVR24 assessed (4 lost to follow up and 3 fatalities) (PP population). Analysed group comprised 50% male, 54% treatment‐experienced, prevailing comorbidities were hypertension (38%) and diabetes (16%). 250 patients achieved SVR24‐94% in ITT population, 98% in PP population. Results are consistent with the efficacy in noncirrhotic patients from the same registry; from 238 patients with liver fibrosis stages F1‐F3 (ITT) SVR24 was assessed in 225 patients (PP) and 222 achieved SVR24 (93% in ITT population, 99% in PP population). ConClusions: Real world data from Poland regarding OBV/PTV/r ± DSV therapy of HCV infected patients with cirrhosis confirms the high effectiveness of this regimen. Presented results are further reinforced by RWE study performed by Flisiak et al. (2017), where 90 patients with cirrhosis reached SVR24 (72% in ITT and 99% in PP population). The results indicate the effectiveness of Polish drug program.

AB: Background: VerifyNow‐P2Y12VR (VN‐P2Y12) is a point‐of‐care device that measures platelet reactivity. Past assessments of thienopyridine therapy utilizing VN‐P2Y12 have largely come from well‐controlled, clinical trial settings. Consequently, limited data are available describing the use of this technology in a "real‐world" setting. This study sought to describe VN‐P2Y12 results from patients treated with either clopidogrel or prasugrel who were seeking care in a hospital setting. Methods: Clinical and administrative data were collected and analyzed for patients admitted to Huntsville Hospital (Huntsville, Alabama, USA) and who underwent VN‐P2Y12 testing between 1/1/2009, and 10/ 31/2010. VN‐P2Y12 data included P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) and device‐reported % inhibition. Other data assessed included patient demographics, co‐morbidities, clinical history, and use of antiplatelet and other concomitant medications. Descriptive analyses were conducted with t‐tests. Results: 2,882 tests were analyzed of which 2,476 were following clopidogrel dosing and 406 were following prasugrel dosing. Among tests for patients who had received clopidogrel, 64.2% were for males, the mean (SD) age was 64.9 (12.5) years, and 90.8% were Caucasian; for patients who received prasugrel, 67.2% were for males, the mean age was 60.7 (11.1) years, and 90.4% were Caucasian. For clopidogrel and prasugrel patients, respectively, mean PRU (SD) was 206 (90) and 107 (93) (P<0.001) and mean % inhibition (SD) was 31% (26%) and 63% (31%) (P<0.001). Real‐world data suggest that prasugrel is associated with significantly lower PRU and greater % inhibition than clopidogrel, regardless of age, race, gender, diabetes, obesity, or PPI use. Conclusion: In this relatively large cohort of patients in a hospital setting, we found that compared with clopidogrel, treatment with prasugrel was associated with greater platelet inhibition overall and across relevant patient subgroups, including those with co‐morbidities previously shown to be associated with high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel.

AB: Background & Aims: Optimally effective treatment for hepatitis C virus genotype 3 (GT3) is urgently needed, particularly in advanced liver disease. Daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir was efficacious in phase 3 studies. Real‐world data for daclatasvir+sofosbuvir in advanced GT3 infection are presented from the French Temporary Authorisation for Use programme, which allowed patients in need without other treatment options access to daclatasvir ahead of its market authorization. Methods: Patients with F3/F4 fibrosis and/or extrahepatic hepatitis C virus manifestations, post‐liver transplant hepatitis C virus recurrence and/or indication for liver/kidney transplant, were treated with daclatasvir+sofosbuvir (60+400 mg daily) for a recommended duration of 24 weeks. Addition of ribavirin and/or shorter treatment was at physician's discretion. The primary efficacy analysis was sustained virological response at post‐treatment week 12 (SVR12; modified intention‐to‐treat). Safety was assessed by spontaneous adverse event reporting. Results: The efficacy population comprised 333 patients, mostly cirrhotic (77%, of whom 18% were decompensated) and treatment experienced (72%). After 24 weeks of daclatasvir+sofosbuvir, SVR12 was 89% (174/196) overall (95% CI 83.6‐92.5%), 98% (43/44) without cirrhosis (95% CI 88.2‐99.6%) and 86% (129/150) with any degree of cirrhosis (95% CI 79.5‐90.7%), without SVR12 increase in those who received additional ribavirin for 24 weeks (SVR12 82% [50/61; 95% CI 70.5‐89.6%]). Among 516 GT3‐infected patients with safety data, 5 discontinued for adverse events and 11 died. Conclusions: Daclatasvir+sofosbuvir achieved high SVR12 rates and was well tolerated in this large real‐world cohort of GT3‐infected patients with advanced liver disease, without benefit of ribavirin in those treated 24 weeks.

AB: Background and objective: Hydrocodone bitartrate extended release (Hysingla ER, HYD) was previously studied in a 12‐week randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial and a 52‐week open‐label safety study. Both of these preapproval studies allowed dose titration to efficacy. The purpose of the present analysis was to compare dosing and utilization patterns in these previous clinical trials with real‐world data (RWD) usage in a retrospective claim analysis performed 12‐14 months post approval in the US. Methods: In the claim analysis (Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Research Database), patients prescribed HYD between January 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, were followed for up to 6 months of continuous HYD use. Daily average consumption (DACON), initial dose, rescue opioid use and total milligram dose over time were also evaluated. Results: HYD daily dose stabilized at ~60 mg dose once daily across all three studies. There was also a reduced need for rescue medication with HYD, resulting in a lower total opioid milligram dose over time. In the claim analysis, the mean monthly HYD dose increased from 49 to 55 mg in month 2 and then remained stable through month 6. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) time on drug was 79.5 days (61.42 days), and DACON was 1.04 pills/day, corresponding to the approved full prescribing information (FPI) and once‐daily dosing. Conclusion: In 12‐14 months post approval, real‐world dosing and utilization of HYD mirrored registration and open‐label study findings, with stable once‐daily dosing of ~60 mg and no increase in rescue medicine utilization.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.2212
AB: Objectives: Overall survival (OS) is an established outcome in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing new cancer treatments. However, because characteristics of patients included in RCTS typically deviate from real‐world patient characteristics, it is unclear whether OS outcomes as shown in RCTS can be used to estimate the real‐world OS associated with observed treatments. We aimed to compare the OS reported in a recent RCT for advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients receiving first‐line chemotherapy with the real‐world OS of that chemotherapy. Methods: Using claims data from a German sickness fund, we identified patients diagnosed with aNSCLC initiating a first‐line chemotherapy (minimum follow‐up 18 months). OS data from the aNSCLC‐RCT were extracted by digitizing the reported Kaplan‐Meier curve (KMC) of the chemotherapy group. The real‐world KMC was adjusted using propensity score reweights with regard to the aggregated aNSCLC‐RCT patient characteristics. Survival outcomes were finally compared using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: 95 aNSCLC‐patients initiating first‐line chemotherapy were identified in the real‐world data‐set, median OS was 12.2 months (95%CI:7.2‐14.8). The RCT included 151 patients in the chemotherapy group, median OS was not reached after 18 months. Once an adjusted patient sample was used (adjustment for differences in age, gender, brain metastases, smoking status), median OS of observed 95 patients decreased from 12.2 to 8.1 months (95%CI:4.3‐12.0). If this KMC is compared to the RCT‐KMC, patients seemed to have a better survival prognosis in the RCT in comparison to the real‐world (Hazard ratio:1.89; 95%CI:1.35‐2.65). ConClusions: Our analysis confirms that the real‐world OS of a treatment is likely to be worse than OS of that same treatment in RCTs, even if an adjustment for differences in patient characteristics is done. Whether this is related to any unobserved differences in patient characteristics or to differences in the diagnosis/treatment framework needs to be further investigated.

AB: Purpose: The goal of the Phase IV ORBIT study is to prospectively and systematically collect real‐world data on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes in symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) patients treated with ocriplasmin according to standard of care in US retina clinics. Another objective of the study is to further define patient criteria that will improve clinical outcomes compared to those from the Phase III MIVI‐TRUST trial results. Methods: ORBIT is a multicenter, prospective, observational Phase IV study that has enrolled 542 patients across 90 clinical sites. Patients are enrolled at the time of a single injection of ocriplasmin 0.125 mug and followed for up to 12 months. Treatment decisions, including the frequency and timing of patient visits after injection, are at the discretion of the treating physician following standard of care and are not mandated by the study design. Clinical effectiveness and safety data are entered in electronic case report forms based on investigator assessments. Images taken by spectral‐domain optical coherence tomography are uploaded to a central reading center for independent review. Results: Here we present the complete patient baseline data and the efficacy results up to 6 months follow‐up according to various patient characteristics. Pharmacological VMA resolution at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months will be reported according to key baseline characteristics: adhesion size, lens status, injection position, presence of full‐thickness macular hole, and presence of an epiretinal membrane. Final 6‐month efficacy data, as well as safety reports, will be presented. Conclusions: Data collected from the ORBIT study will provide a real‐world efficacy and safety profile of ocriplasmin, better characterize postinjection patient experiences, and help identify patients who may respond best to ocriplasmin therapy. The results presented here will further characterize appropriate patient selection for ocriplasmin treatment compared to the patient characteristics identified from the Phase III MIVI‐TRUST studies, including injection position which will be the first time this data is reported.

AB: Objectives: Label extension into new oncology indications, increasing drug prices, and improved technology resources are driving U.S. payers to consider indication‐specific pricing (ISP) strategies for high‐priced cancer treatments. Under this model, a therapy’s reimbursement status varies based on value and/or efficacy across multiple indications for which a drug is approved. This study explores the current and future use of ISPs, how payers determine value of a drug for an indication, and how data is tracked. Methods: Payer adoption and features of their ISPs was obtained by a survey of 41 pharmacy and medical directors at U.S. commercial health plans in January 2018. Results: All surveyed payers were aware of ISPs and 34% performed research in preparation to implement these programs. Among all surveyed payers, 71% anticipated adopting an ISP strategy in the next 12 months and would adjust rebates accordingly. These payers plan to track diagnosis through prior authorization (54%) or through physicians documenting diagnosis separately (42%). To determine the value of a drug in a specific indication, payers will most commonly rely upon randomized clinical trial data with 52% citing phase II/III or post‐approval research as the most important resource. Another 28% cited real‐world data or evidence as the most important resource, while the remaining 20% will leverage other clinical information, clinical guidelines, or third‐party value assessment tools. Conclusions: Survey responses point to ISP use expanding, fueled by cost concerns and improved ability to patients and measure clinical effectiveness. The overwhelming reliance on clinical trial data to determine clinical value suggest that that payers prefer to leverage the existing tools historically used in value assessment. However, the 49% that cited RWE as either the most or second‐most important resource point to RWE’s growing importance in ISP as payers become more comfortable with leveraging the data’s potential.

AB: Purpose: Stargardt disease (SD) is a rare, blinding inherited macular dystrophy that most commonly affects children and young adults. Evidence in the literature suggests that children and adolescents presenting with SD (Early‐Onset Stargardt Disease, EOSD) progress faster to severe retinal degeneration than patients developing the disease in adulthood. Currently, there is lack of a clear definition for this early‐onset population and a scarcity of real world data describing the disease progression in early‐onset patients from the first onset of symptoms. The purpose of this study is to better define and describe the natural history of EOSD. Methods: This non‐interventional, multinational, multicenter, retrospective chart review study will collect demographic data from SD patients including age at symptoms onset and clincal diagnosis and ABCA4 genotyping in Europe (France, Germany, UK, Italy, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands) and the US. For patients with EOSD, defined as onset of Stargardt symptoms in childhood, adolescence or in young adults <= 26 years old and at least one pathogenic mutant ABCA4 allele, additional data from the 1st recorded visit through 5 years of follow‐up will be obtained to detail the course of disease progression. The primary outcome variable is the yearly rate of visual acuity progression in patients with EOSD. Results: Based on the results of a feasibility study approximately 140 EOSD patients are foreseen to be enrolled in this study from approximately 52 investigators sites (38 in Europe and 14 in the US). Interim data will be presented. Conclusions: There is no effective treatment for SD. A definition and description of the clinical course of EOSD patients will aide in the development of new therapies for SD by documenting a population with the highest disease morbidity in whom intervention would be expected to provide the greatest potential benefit and by generating evidence to support the selection of efficacy outcomes to be evaluated in future investigational clinical trials.

AB: Objectives: Research design is complicated by a multitude of factors, including the differing evidentiary needs of health system stakeholders, the differing measures that meet their needs, and the differing methodologic approaches that can be used to collect clinical, economic and real‐world data. Health economists have developed algorithms for use in selecting the most appropriate modeling approach, but no such solution exists for selecting the most appropriate real‐world research design. The objective of this study was to develop and test an algorithm that addresses this gap. Methods: The algorithm consists of a series of structured yes/no questions, as follows: (1) Is the study focused on an intervention? (2) If so, is the intervention on the market? (3) Is the study intended to be comparative? (4) If so, is treatment assigned by study protocol? (5) Are data needed for the study available from existing sources? (6) If so, are those existing sources accessible in computerized form (i.e., in administrative claims or electronic medical records)? And (7) is the study setting real world? As research designs vary dramatically in terms of time and cost requirements, the algorithm steers the researcher to the most cost‐effective option first in those instances in which multiple approaches are viable. Results: Responding to each of these yes/no questions within the structure of the algorithm successfully guides the researcher to one of six different research designs: (1) retrospective database analysis; (2) manual chart review; (3) prospective non‐interventional study/registry; (4) traditional randomized controlled trial; (5) pragmatic clinical trial; or (6) economic modeling. Conclusions: Algorithms have proven invaluable to guide health economists on optimal selection of modeling approach. This research shows that an algorithmic approach also can facilitate selection of optimal real‐world research design based on structured responses to a series of questions regarding the study focus and objectives.

AB: Background: Treatments associated with excellent outcomes in a research setting in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) may not be beneficial in the real‐world settings which has a different spectrum of patients in different clinical situations. Therefore, healthcare providers are looking for evidence in the real‐world setting in addition to RCTs. In this background, health insurance claims data are a source of invaluable real‐world data. Claims data are increasingly being used for pharmacoeconomic and outcomes researchin regions like North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The major advantages of claims data over RCT data include: (a) health outcomes can be evaluated in real‐world settings; (b) analysis results can be generalised to a broader population; (c) relatively inexpensivethan RCTs; (d) provide wide range of information about various conditions and procedures from a large number of patients, belonging to varied demographics; (e) data availability over extended periods of time allow retrospective cohort studies; (f) unaffected by recall bias; (g) large sample size will make the statistical methods more consistent. However, there are some limitations as well, such as incomplete diagnostic and provider identification data, and the fact that the population characteristics are largely influenced by the insurance plan, plan benefit design, and the variables of the database. Claims data in India are insufficiently used for health outcomes research. An important reason for this is that the penetration of health insurance is not up to the mark in India. It is expected that health insurance will become more popular in India, since (a) Indian health care expenditure is predominantly out‐ofpocket, and (b) the healthcare costs are escalating day‐by‐day. RECOMMENDATIONS: With the increased penetration of health insurance in India, appropriate analysis of the resulting claims data can provide invaluable insights into demographics, disease trends, efficacy and effectiveness, and real‐world information, from the Indian perspective.

AB: Objectives: The 'evidence hierarchy' of randomized controlled trial (RCT) over non‐ RCT evidence is well‐established, and RCTs remain the 'gold standard' for regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) submissions. However, adaptive pathways will likely necessitate the future use of non‐RCT evidence in the HTA‐decisionmaking process. To inform future submissions, we assessed acceptance based on non‐RCT evidence across four HTA agencies, and explored agencies' reactions to such study designs. Methods: All single HTA appraisals in 2015 from NICE, CADTH, PBAC, and IQWiG were included in the analysis, including resubmissions. Multiple technology appraisals, vaccines, and requests for advice were excluded. The recommendation, reasoning behind the recommendation, and whether or not a non‐RCT design trial (e.g. single‐arm or observational) was included in the submission, were extracted. Results: A total of 189 appraisals were extracted: 49 for CADTH, 59 for PBAC, 36 for NICE, and 45 for IQWiG. Non‐RCT evidence was considered in 5 CADTH appraisals (10%), 12 PBAC appraisals (20%), 13 NICE appraisals (36%), and no IQWiG appraisals. Only three treatments were given a positive recommendation solely on the basis on non‐RCT evidence in 2015: daclatasvir for HCV GT3 infection (CADTH, PBAC), ponatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia (PBAC), and darunavir/cobicistat for HIV infection (CADTH). The remaining submissions included additional RCT evidence or were rejected due to high uncertainty about treatment effect. Non‐RCT evidence did, however, contribute to a favorable outcome in some submissions, e.g. idelalisib for CLL and tolvaptan for PKD (NICE). Co nclusions: NICE, CADTH, and PBAC will consider non‐RCT studies such as real‐world data and single‐arm trials in certain circumstances, but are critical of the lower certainty of the evidence. The contribution of non‐RCT evidence to the HTA‐decision‐making process is currently minor; however, as adaptive pathways and personalized treatment strategies gain momentum, HTA bodies will need to become more flexible in their approach to assessing non‐RCT evidence.

AB: Objectives: To‐date, several studies have evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using data from randomised controlled trials. This study will investigate the real‐world cost‐effectiveness of CABG compared with PCI with stents in high‐risk patients with multi‐vessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD). An Australian public hospital payer perspective will be adopted. Methods: Data for 3508 patients (CABG: N= 1,440; PCI:N= 2,068 ) admitted to a major metropolitan hospital was obtained from two clinical registries, the Melbourne Interventional Group (MIG) and the Australian & New Zealand Society of Cardiac & Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS). Hospital readmissions and related patient‐level costs were obtained for the period of June 2009 to December 2014, from the same institution. The maximum follow‐up period was five years. Adjustments for inflation and discounting will be performed over this period. Propensity score matching through the Nearest Neighbour technique will be used to balance the characteristics between the treatment (CABG) and comparator (PCI) groups. The primary and secondary measures of effectiveness will be major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiac events (MACCE), and mortality, respectively. The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per MACCE avoided, and life years gained will be evaluated. Propensity score bin bootstrapping (PSBB) will be performed to further validate the results. Results: Although several limitations apply to this analysis, we expect results to be similar to existing literature, which favours CABG compared with PCI with stents in the medium to long term. We expect highly favourable ICERs for CABG in sub‐groups of patients at highest risk of complications. Conclusions: This study will reveal the cost‐effectiveness of CABG compared with PCI using real‐world data and new propensity score techniques.

AB: “Precision oncology” has existed as a concept for decades, where medicines target specific genetic aberrations within a cancer type (e.g. HER2+ breast cancer). Taking the next step, several medicines are aiming for EMA approval in indications defined by rare genomic characteristics, agnostic to tumour location. This abstract discusses the implications of aligning this genome‐driven approach with the evidence requirements of NICE. Precision oncology trials often recruit low patient numbers into a single‐arm/basket study, due to small eligible patient populations. Expedited regulatory pathways support the early evaluation of these studies based on promising outcomes, e.g. response rates. Whilst appropriate for a benefit‐risk assessment, non‐randomised, surrogate outcomes require extrapolation to estimate lifetime clinical benefit, causing significant uncertainty as to the incremental treatment effect. Comparator data may also be limited. In the absence of routine genomic sequencing, natural history and quality of life data for patients with the specific abnormality will be sparse. Modelling of treatment patterns, and corresponding resource use/costs, must represent the different tumour pathways which may be heterogeneous and poorly defined. These issues will cause high levels of decision uncertainty within current HTA frameworks. Early manufacturer‐payer engagement will be essential to define the appraisal framework and agree current and future evidence requirements. Initial assessment may rely substantially on real‐world data and expert input. Managed entry agreements, e.g. through the Cancer Drugs Fund, could represent a promising route for access. These allow mitigation of uncertainty through ongoing data collection, which is reviewed as the product value proposition matures. While genome‐driven oncology offers significant potential to improve patient outcomes, it is associated with higher levels of uncertainty than “standard” oncology treatments. Collaboration and flexibility between industry and healthcare systems will be key to realise the potential of these innovations, and in England to support the NHS’ vision of leadership in genomic medicine.

AB: Background and aims: Teneligliptin was introduced in India in May 2015. It has gained popularity and is already widely prescribed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This "real life" data collection was conducted to assess the efficacy of teneligliptin in Indian T2DM patients. Methods: Predesigned structured proforma was used to collect information from the prescribing physicians regarding the efficacy of teneligliptin when prescribed as monotherapy as well as combination therapy with other antidiabetic drugs in T2DM patients. Information on the glycemic parameters at baseline prior to starting teneligliptin and at the end of 3 months therapy was collected. The efficacy was assessed by analyzing the mean change in 3‐month values of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG). Results: Data of 4305 patients was available for analysis. There was statistically significant improvement in mean HbA1c, FPG, and PPG with teneligliptin therapy. Means changes in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG were ‐1.37%+/‐1.15%, 51.29+35.41 mg/dL, and 80.89+54.27 mg/dL, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that HbA1c (%) reduction with teneligliptin when used as monotherapy, add‐on to metformin or add‐on to metformin plus sulfonylureas combination, add‐on to metformin plus alpha glucosidase inhibitor combination or add‐on to insulin was 0.98+0.53, 1.07+0.83, 1.46+1.33, 1.43+0.80, and 1.55+1.05, respectively. Conclusion: Real‐world data suggests that teneligliptin significantly improves glycemic control in Indian patients with T2DM when prescribed either as monotherapy or as an add‐on to one or more other commonly prescribed antidiabetic drugs.

AB: Background: Front‐of‐pack nutrition labelling may support healthier packaged food purchases. Australia has adopted a novel Health Star Rating (HSR) system, but the legitimacy of this choice is unknown. Objective: To define the effects of different formats of front‐of‐pack labelling on the healthiness of food purchases and consumer perceptions. Design: Individuals were assigned at random to access one of four different formats of nutrition labelling—HSR, multiple traffic light labels (MTL), daily intake guides (DIG), recommendations/warnings (WARN)—or control (the nutrition information panel, NIP). Participants accessed nutrition information by using a smartphone application to scan the bar‐codes of packaged foods, while shopping. The primary outcome was healthiness defined by the mean transformed nutrient profile score of packaged foods that were purchased over four weeks. Results: The 1578 participants, mean age 38 years, 84% female recorded purchases of 148,727 evaluable food items. The mean healthiness of the purchases in the HSR group was non‐inferior to MTL, DIG, or WARN (all p < 0.001 at 2% non‐inferiority margin). When compared to the NIP control, there was no difference in the mean healthiness of purchases for HSR, MTL, or DIG (all p > 0.07), but WARN resulted in healthier packaged food purchases (mean difference 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.72; p = 0.04). HSR was perceived by participants as more useful than DIG, and easier to understand than MTL or DIG (all p < 0.05). Participants also reported the HSR to be easier to understand, and the HSR and MTL to be more useful, than NIP (all p < 0.03). Conclusions: These real‐world data align with experimental findings and provide support for the policy choice of HSR. Recommendation/warning labels warrant further exploration, as they may be a stronger driver of healthy food purchases.

AB: Objective: Prednisolone is used as glucocorticoid replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency (AI). Recent data indicate that its use in AI is associated with low bone mineral density. Data on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with AI treated with prednisolone are scarce, despite this condition being the predominant cause of excess mortality. We aimed to address this question using real‐world data from the European Adrenal Insufficiency Registry (EU‐AIR). Design/methods: EU‐AIR, comprising of 19 centres across Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, commenced enrolling patients with AI in August 2012. Patients receiving prednisolone (3‐6 mg/day, n = 50) or hydrocortisone (15‐30 mg/day, n = 909) were identified and grouped at a ratio of 1:3 (prednisolone:hydrocortisone) by matching for gender, age, duration and type of disease. Data from baseline and follow‐up visits were analysed. Data from patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were excluded. Results: Significantly higher mean +/‐ s.d. total (6.3 +/‐ 1.6 vs 5.4 +/‐ 1.1 mmol/L; P = 0.003) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (3.9 +/‐ 1.4 vs 3.2 +/‐ 1.0 mmol/L; P = 0.013) were identified in 47 patients on prednisolone vs 141 receiving hydrocortisone at baseline and at follow‐up (P = 0.005 and P = 0.006, respectively). HbA1c, high‐density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and waist circumference were not significantly different. Conclusions: This is the first matched analysis of its kind. Significantly higher LDL levels in patients receiving prednisolone relative to hydrocortisone could predict a higher relative risk of cardiovascular disease in the former group.

AB: Background: Real‐world data of the subcutaneous immunotherapy with Semi‐ Depot House Dust Mite Allergen Extract (HDM‐SCIT) (a house dust mite allergen extract containing a 50%/50% mixture of D. pteronyssinus and D. farina) for allergic rhinitis and asthma is unavailable in China until recently. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a HDM‐SCIT for allergic rhinitis and asthma in Chinese patients. Method: This was a multi‐center, singlearm, open‐label, self‐controlled study. Chinese patients with allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma and history of symptoms at house dust mite exposure were included, and received allergen‐specific immunotherapy for 1 year by subcutaneous injection of HDM‐SCIT. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with an improvement in symptom severity assessed at 12 months after initiation of the treatment. Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and compliance of treatment were also evaluated. Results: 272 outpatients were included for effectiveness analysis. Subject‐evaluated improvement rate in VAS was 76.1% and 71.3% at 6 and 12 months, respectively; corresponding values for investigator‐evaluated VAS were 77.9% and 71.7% (P < 0.0001). Symptom score changes were ‐2.43 and ‐3.79 at 6 and 12 months, respectively (both P < 0.0001); VAS improvement rate and symptom score change did not differ significantly between children and adolescents/adults. 98.8% of patients had good injection schedule adherence. No study drug‐related serious AEs or serious systemic allergic reactions occurred. Conclusion: HDM‐SCIT is safety and effectiveness in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma in a Chinese population with a good compliance.

AB: Background: Dermatologic toxicity can be a limiting factor for the use of anti‐EGFR therapy such as panitumumab. There is a paucity of real world data regarding the management of dermatologic toxicity among metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with panitumumab in the United States (U.S.). The objective of this study is to describe oncologist's opinions regarding timing of skin rash management in relation to the initiation of treatment and perceptions regarding rash management strategies. Methods: A total of 125 oncologists were recruited from a national database via a third independent party. Eligible oncologists (i.e.: licensed and practicing oncologist who had treated at least three new or continuing mCRC patients with panitumumab in the last year) completed an online survey to report their opinions regarding the grade and type of dermatologic toxicities seen and their perceptions about management strategies for mCRC patients who are treated with panitumumab. The timing of rash management initiation was defined as pre‐emptive (prior to the appearance of the rash) or reactive (after any signs of skin rash). Results: Based upon their collective experience, oncologists expect that 44% of patients will develop acneiform rash while on treatment. More than half (58%) of the oncologists reported they did not follow any practice guidelines regarding the management of dermatologic toxicities. The oncologists reported that they preemptively initiated the management of dermatologic toxicities in 53% of their patients. Skin moisturizer and sunscreen were reported to be the most critical preemptive management approach, while skin moisturizer, over‐the‐counter topical steroids, and oral antibiotics were reported to be the most critical reactive management tools for Grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusions: Despite evidence from randomized controlled trials, a majority of oncologists do not follow guidelines for dermatologic management of EGFR‐I rash. There is a clear need for better physician education and awareness of mitigation strategies for skin toxicity management in mCRC patients treated with panitumumab.

AB: Objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in real‐world clinical settings in Japan. Methods: Paediatric patients with sJIA initiating TCZ between April 2008 and February 2012 and those previously enrolled in clinical trials who initiated TCZ before April 2008 were enrolled in a Japanese registry surveillance programme. Safety and effectiveness parameters were collected for 52 weeks. Results: Of 417 patients enrolled, mean age was 11.2 years and 48.0% were female. TCZ exposure was 407.0 patient‐years (PYs). Baseline corticosteroid use was higher than in clinical trials. Rates of total adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were 224.3/100 PYs and 54.5/100 PYs, respectively, with SAEs higher than previously reported. The most frequent AEs and SAEs were infections and infestations (69.8/100 PYs and 18.2/100 PYs, respectively). 74 serious infections occurred in 55 patients (18.2/100 PYs); higher than previously reported. 26 macrophage activation syndrome events were reported in 24 patients (6.4/100 PYs). Fever and rash symptoms improved from baseline to week 52 (54.6% to 5.6% and 43.0% to 5.6%, respectively). At 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 52 weeks, 90.5%, 96.2% and 99.0% of patients achieved normal C reactive protein levels (<0.3 mg/dL), respectively. Conclusions: These first real‐world data demonstrated that TCZ was well tolerated, with acceptable safety and effectiveness in patients with sJIA. Higher incidences of SAEs and serious infections may be due to differences, such as corticosteroid use and concomitant diseases, between patient populations enrolled in previously reported clinical trials and this study.

AB: Background: A post authorization safety study (PASS) is a study of a marketed drug or biologic conducted in an effort to confirm the safety profile or identify potential safety issues not identified in the controlled clinical trial population. A PASS may be done voluntarily or in response to requirements imposed by an approving authority. According to the ENCePP website, there are 228 PASS protocols registered, of which 187 are currently in active recruiting or planning status. Objectives: To understand how PASS are being utilized in current post‐marketing research. To discuss key considerations when designing and implementing a prospective observational PASS based on selected case studies. Methods: A targeted search was conducted in PubMed to identify all original research published in 2013 reporting results from prospective PASS. The search was restricted to English language publications. Abstracts of relevant citations were reviewed to obtain the country of study, therapeutic area, product, subject population and study design. Results: The search returned 48 citations, containing 11 citations reporting results from prospective PASS. Amongst the 11 studies, n = 4 (36.4%) were conducted in Europe, n = 4 (36.4%) in Asia‐Pacific n = 1 (9.1%) in the United States, n = 1 (9.1%) in South America and n = 1 (9.1%) globally. Sample sizes range from 10‐7943 patients excluding 2 database analytics studies. Therapeutic areas include oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, psychiatry and infectious diseases. Safety reporting requirements vary by country, with the guidelines more defined in Europe (EU) and the US. Conclusions: The purpose of the present review was not to perform an exhaustive summary of all PASS protocols but to gain information regarding study design that provides the most valuable result. Results of this review confirm that different protocol designs are being used in real‐world data collection to meet specific safety surveillance objectives. For prospective, observational PASS, early determination of country specific requirements is essential to ensure collection and reporting of robust data in a timely manner.

AB: Purpose: Increased focus has been put on the use of "'real‐world" data to support randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence for clinical decision‐making. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of an annular closure device (ACD) after stratifying a consecutive series of "real‐world" patients by the screening criteria of an ongoing RCT. Materials and methods: This was a single‐center registry analysis of 164 subjects who underwent limited discectomy combined with ACD for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. Patients were stratified into two groups using the selection criteria of a pivotal RCT on the same device: Trial (met inclusion; n44) or non‐Trial (did not meet inclusion; n120). Patientreported outcomes, including Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) for leg and back pain, and adverse events were collected from baseline to last follow‐up (mean: Trial ‐ 15.6 months; non‐Trial ‐ 14.6 months). Statistical analyses were performed with significance set at p<0.05. Results: Patient‐reported outcomes were not significantly different between groups at last followup (p>=0.15) and clinical success (>=15‐point improvement in ODI score; >=20‐point improvement in VAS scores) was achieved in both the groups. Three non‐Trial (2.5%) and three Trial (6.8%) patients experienced symptomatic reherniation (p0.34). Rates of reoperation, ACD mesh dislocation/separation, and other radiographic findings were similar between groups (p1.00). Conclusion: Outcomes with the ACD appeared advantageous in both the groups, particularly in comparison with historical reherniation rates reported in the same high‐risk, large annular defect population. Stratification of this "real‐world" series on the basis of RCT screening criteria did not result in significant between‐group differences. These findings suggest that the efficacy of the ACD extends beyond the strictly defined patient population being studied in the RCT of this device. Furthermore, reducing the reherniation rate following lumbar discectomy has positive clinical and economic implications. Copyright © 2018 Kursumovic' and Rath.

AB: Background: RCT are not transferable to routine care due to necessary inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thus data are needed that reflect treatment reality in routine care to decide whether results and treatment recommendations from RCT can be transferred into routine care. Treatment outcome (overall survival) should be compared between RCT and “real world data” from oncology group practices. Methods: All consecutive patients suffering from a metastatic or locally advanced inoperable tumor of the breast, lung, colorectal or pancreas who had been treated in oncology group practices in Germany between 1995 and 2016 were evaluated retrospectively. Relevant clinical data concerning diagnosis, treatment and survival were extracted from patient files into a database and analyzed statistically using SPSS. Results: 2,467 patients with advanced cancer were analyzed. 838 suffered from metastatic breast cancer, 736 from non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (29% locally advanced, 71% metastatic), 526 from colorectal cancer (2% locally advanced, 98% metastatic) and 324 from pancreatic cancer (26% locally advanced, 74% metastatic). Data from breast, lung and colorectal cancer were monocentric, data from pancreatic cancer were collected in 4 institutions. Overall survival (OS) data compared favorably with registry data and were comparable to RCT. Median OS in metastatic breast cancer was 35.9 months compared to 21.2 months ‐ median not reached in RCT. Median OS in NSCLC was 13.5 months compared to 8.2 months ‐ median not reached in RCT. Median OS in colorectal cancer was 22.7 months compared to 10.8 ‐ 34.2 months in RCT. Median OS in pancreatic cancer was 7.7 months compared to 5.9 ‐ 13.1 months in RCT. Conclusions: Survival of patients with advanced solid tumors of the breast, lung, colorectal and pancreas who are treated in oncology group practices is comparable to RCT. Results from RCT are transferable to routine care if treatment results of patients with similar characteristics are compared.

AB: Background: Electronic healthcare databases (EHDs) provide real world data of clinical practice with broader patient populations and have been increasingly used for post marketing drug safety surveillance over past decade. However, few studies have examined the potentials of these data sources in China. Objectives: To evaluate the availability and characteristics of EHDs for post‐marketing drug safety surveillance in China. Methods: Three major types of EHDs in China, including two regional community based databases, one annual sample of national claims database, and one electronic medical records (EMR) database covering 40 hospitals, were selected for the evaluation. A questionnaire was designed to understand data accessibility, basic database characteristics, and core variables in the databases for post‐marketing drug safety surveillance (i.e. 39 key variables derived from US Mini‐Sentinel common data model etc.). The survey questionnaire was sent to the owners of each database on June 15, 2015 and the respondents were contacted by email, telephone, or face‐face interview if retuned responses were ambiguous. Results: All database owners responded all questions on the survey. Three database owners confirmed their willingness to share the databases with academic institutions. However, access to national claims data required a special approval procedure. Two regional databases contain 3.6 and 1.2 million patients with 90% and 82% of core variables available respectively. The claims data were resampled annually from the entire country (6.6 million people in 2013) and had 64% of core variables. The EMR database consists of 3 million inpatient data with 87% core variables. Lab data are available in 3 databases except for claims data. Diagnosis data are available in all 4 databases while the clinical symptom data can only be found in one regional database. Inconsistent drug and diagnosis coding systems are seen across 4 databases. Conclusions: The survey provided valuable data on 3 major types of EHDs for potential post‐marketing drug safety surveillance in China. Future research is warranted to assess the quality and completeness of these data sources.

AB: Objectives: Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs), such as exenatide once weekly (EQW) and liraglutide (LIRA), are FDA‐approved as treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Head‐to‐head studies and meta‐analyses of these agents have reached different conclusions about their relative effectiveness. Methods: We developed a decision‐analytic model to evaluate the likely incremental cost‐effectiveness of EQW versus LIRA 1.8 mg in T2DM patients, with effectiveness measured as reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The model structure tracks change in HbA1c and direct medical expenditure (drug, needle, adverse events [AEs]) over a 26‐week time horizon, and allows patients to discontinue treatment due to AEs (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia) after 1 or 3 months of therapy. Patients discontinuing treatment are assumed to return to their baseline HbA1c. We compared the outcomes (cost per 1% and 0.2% reduction in HbA1c) of models populated with clinical data from a head‐to‐head 26‐week randomized, controlled trial (DURATION‐6) and a meta‐analysis conducted by Scott and colleagues (2012). Drug costs and other utilization costs were based on wholesale acquisition costs and published sources. Results: For the base case, the projected total 6‐month cost of EQW versus LIRA was $2,444 and $3,054, respectively. Using data from DURATION‐6 and meta‐analysis, compared with EQW, LIRA had a projected incremental cost per 1% reduction in HbA1c (ICER) of $3,262 and $18,578 over a 6‐month time horizon, respectively. Compared with EQW, the projected 6‐month cost per 0.2% reduction in HbA1c for LIRA was $652 and $3,716 based on data from DURATION‐6 and meta‐analysis, respectively. Conclusions: The projected cost per 1% reduction in HbA1c was lower with EQW than liraglutide 1.8 mg at 6 months. The difference in projected cost per HbA1c reduction varies significantly depending on the trial‐based data sources used. Real‐world data are needed to resolve the current uncertainties.

DOI: 10.1007/s12664-018-0911-4
AB: Background Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a prevalent condition imposing health care burden, impaired quality of life, and a therapeutic challenge due to non‐specific symptoms. FD symptoms and delayed gastric emptying are often seen in and further worsen the quality of life in diabetic patients. Acotiamide is a first‐in‐class gastro‐kinetic drug, enhancing acetylcholine release and representing an appropriate therapeutic option to fill the need gap in specific, and effective FD drugs. Though evidence of its efficacy and tolerance are available through randomized clinical trials, real world data from its inclinic use is lacking. Methodology Three hundred and fourteen patients with meal‐related FD symptoms, visiting 63 gastroenterology clinics across India, received Acotiamide 100 mg TID for 4 weeks and were evaluated for patient's perception of improvement in presenting symptoms, and tolerance to treatment. Results Treatment response rate (complete relief or significant improvement) for the symptoms of post‐prandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiety was achieved by 79.2%, 74.4%, and 77.1% patients respectively. (p<0.001 for all vs. no/slight improvement). A sub‐analysis of 71 diabetic patients showed no significant difference in symptomatic relief between diabetic and non‐diabetic patients (response rate for symptoms of post‐prandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiety in diabetic vs. non‐diabetic patients was 76.3% vs. 82.3%; p=0.81, 82.63% vs. 76%; p=0.25, and 76.2% vs. 83.2%; p=0.36, respectively). Significantly more number of patients achieved complete relief when treated for >28 days or 14‐28 days than when treated for less than 2 weeks (p<0.05). Mild, transient adverse events were reported in 6% cases with only 2 patients discontinuing treatment. Conclusion This real‐world study suggests that use of Acotiamide was associated with improvement of meal‐related FD symptoms with in both diabetics and non‐diabetic Indian patients with good safety profile.

DOI: 10.1510/icvts.2011.0000S6
AB: Objectives: The role of extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) has come into question in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Results of randomised controlled trials (RCT) may be rejected as not applicable to 'real world' outcomes, either because RCT outcomes may not be replicated subsequently in clinical practice or because the RCT reported outcomes are inferior to those previously reported in cohort studies. We compared the outcomes of the mesothelioma and radical surgery (MARS) trial with so called 'real world' data. Methods: Cohorts reporting median survival for patients undergoing EPP in large studies in the last decade were sought. For non‐operated patients, median survival in studies published before or during MARS were retrieved. Outcomes for patients in the non‐treated arm of a chemotherapy RCT and a large institutional report were also extracted. Results: Large studies or phase II trials including 45 to 385 patients reported median survival of 10 to 23 months after EPP. Data superpose on MARS EPP survival data and were inferior to the median survival of non‐operated patients in MARS. Survival of non‐operated patients in two pilot studies for MARS were seven and 13 months which bracketed the 10 month survival in two non‐operated cohorts reported during MARS recruitment. Conclusions: MARS EPP outcomes are comparable with those reported in cohort studies and therefore the evidence from MARS can be relied upon as applicable to 'real world' practice. Survival of non‐operated patients is highly dependent on the source of the data and factors, such as lead time bias. However, there is no evidence from MARS, cohort studies, or phase II trials that EPP offers a survival advantage over the natural or otherwise treated survival in malignant pleural mesothelioma.

AB: Purpose Purpose The large Phase IV ORBIT study prospectively and systematically collects real‐world data on clinical outcomes and safety in patients receiving ocriplasmin according to standard of care in US retina clinics. This study provides real‐world efficacy and safety data complementary to the Phase III MIVI‐TRUST trials and may further define appropriate patients for ocriplasmin treatment. Methods ORBIT is a multicenter, prospective, observational Phase IV study that plans to enroll 1500 patients from approximately 120 US clinical retina sites. Patients are enrolled at the time of ocriplasmin injection, and baseline and post‐injection data are collected; patients are followed for up to 12 months. Treatment decisions, including the frequency and timing of patient visits after injection, are at the discretion of the treating physician following standard of care, and are not mandated by the study design. Clinical effectiveness and safety data are entered in electronic case report forms, based on investigator assessments. SD‐OCT images are uploaded to a central reading center for independent review. Results Here we present preliminary demographic and patient baseline data obtained from the initial 6 months of the ORBIT study. Data from both investigator and reading center assessments, as well as clinical outcome and safety data captured over the first 6 months of the study are included. As of 11/11/14, 243 patients were enrolled from 110 clinics. Baseline demographics and ocular characteristics for these 243 patients are presented in Table 1. Mean age is 79 years (range=46‐92 years); 66% of patients are female. Pre‐injection ocular symptoms (in >3% of patients) included decreased visual acuity, metamorphopsia, floaters, central visual field defect/central black spot, difficulty reading at close distance, photopsia, and eye pain/ocular discomfort. (Table 1) Conclusions Data collected from the ORBIT study will assess the real‐world efficacy and safety profile of ocriplasmin, better characterize post‐injection patient experiences, and help identify patients who may respond best to ocriplasmin therapy.

DOI: 10.1186/s13223-017-0192-y
AB: Background: As there are limited publications on real‐life use omalizumab in chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in Canada, there is a need to generate data to inform us of patient characteristics and use of omalizumab. The study aims to describe patient demographics and treatment patterns of patients prescribed omalizumab in a real‐world Canadian setting. Methods: Following regulatory approval, a nationwide patient support program (PSP) was made available to all Canadian patients prescribed omalizumab. Baseline demographics and treatment information were collected for patients who provided consent, enrolled between August 26 2014 and April 21 2016; additional patient reported information was collected as of November 2015. Results: The cohort included 1391 patients enrolled in the PSP who received at least one dose of omalizumab (71% women; average age: 46). Most patients (73%) were prescribed OMA 300 mg q4wks while 15% were prescribed 150 mg q4wks; 12% of patients were treated with other dosing regimens. Treatment history was reported by 191 patients; 70% reported being treated with >=1 H1‐antihistamine while 35% received montelukast. Prednisone was used in 24% of patients; use of cyclosporine was uncommon. Data on angioedema was available for 130 patients; 65% reported having a history of angioedema, 26% had not experienced angioedema, while 8% did not know. ER visits in the last year were reported by 137 patients; 55% reported not having visited the ER while the rest had been at least once. Average omalizumab treatment persistency is 13 months. Conclusion: In a real‐life world Canadian setting, omalizumab is prescribed to a population comparable to that of the Phase 3 clinical program. Treatment history and healthcare resource use were likely underestimated as data were patient reported and collected as of November 2015. There remains a need to further collect and disseminate real‐world data to understand the effectiveness of omalizumab in a real‐world setting.

AB: Introduction: Over the last ten years, trainee‐led research collaboratives have been established within the UK and internationally. Traditional pathways to promote collaboration between researchers can take years to expand beyond individual institutions and regions. Traditional collaboration relied on networking events and meetings, which were limited to geographically accessible areas, chance meetings or expensive trips. We aimed to set up the national Geriatric Medicine Research Collaborative with trainee representatives in all UK training regions. Methods: Our collaborative has been trainee‐led from inception through to project management and conduct. We created national and regional websites to disseminate project information. We utilised a combination of e‐mail communication, social networking, word‐of‐mouth, and dissemination through the British Geriatrics Society (BGS). Project ideas were generated by trainees at an initial meeting and communicated to regional representatives by e‐mail, websites, and social media. Results: We have been successful in obtaining representatives for 13 out of 15 training regions in the UK within three months of creation, including collaboration with the previously formed Welsh Geriatricians Network (WeGeN). Collaborations have begun with other successful specialty networks, including orthopaedics, and general surgery. We have successfully completed two national audit projects, and we are in the process of refining the protocols for two Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs). Conclusions: The Geriatric Medicine Research Collaborative (GeMRC) offers an innovative approach to research conduct. We urgently need to increase capacity in academic geriatric medicine. GeMRC facilitates the opportunity for trainees with limited research experience to be involved in all stages of research (including protocol design, recruitment, and analysis). A national structure allows for the rapid collection of real world data, leading to early analysis, dissemination, and impact upon patient care. Future milestones will be funding and approvals for a nationwide RCT.

AB: Background: The use of thrombectomy during primary PCI (pPCI) is controversial. While randomised trials failed to demonstrate a sizeable benefit, many Operators still use it routinely in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Purpose: To evaluate the effect of thrombectomy on clinical outcome at long‐term follow‐up and TIMI flow in a real world setting. Methods: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients who presented with STEMI between 2005 and 2013. N=835 patients undergoing pPCI + Thrombectomy, were matched 1:1 with patients who underwent pPCI alone. Non‐parsimo nious propensity‐score was used for matching. Thrombectomy was left to operators' preference and performed either with manual or rheolytic device. The primary end‐point was all cause mortality. Secondarily, we assessed the hierarchical incidence of death, recurrent myocardial infarction (re‐MI) and urgent PCI (uPCI) and final TIMI flow. All patients were censored after 4 years follow‐up. Results: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups (Table 1). The use of gpIIbIIIa inhibitors was 55% overall. After a median follow‐up time of 553 days, death occurred in 11.2% of pPCI + Thrombectomy group and 12.6% of pPCI alone group (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.62‐1.21, p=0.40). The composite endpoint of death‐re‐MI‐uPCI occurred in 21.0% of pPCI + Thrombectomy group and 22.0% of pPCI alone group (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67‐1.11, p=0.24), Figure 1. TIMI flow II‐III was more likely obtained in pPCI + Thrombectomy group (97% vs. 94.5%, p=0.015). Conclusions: In patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI with a high prevalence use of IIbIIIa inhibitors, the clinical outcome of pPCI + Thrombectomy was comparable with that of pPCI alone, however pPCI+Thrombectomy was associated with a higher likelihood of final TIMI flow II‐III. These real world data are consistent with the result of randomised clinical trials. (Figure Presented).

AB: Objectives: We evaluated the incidence of lower extremity ischemia and limb occlusion in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the Excluder and C3 Excluder AAA Endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore and Associates Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz). Methods: The Global Registry for Endovascular Aortic Treatment (GREAT) is an industry‐sponsored prospective, multicenter, cohort registry that enrolled >5000 consecutive patients to report real‐world data for the Gore abdominal and thoracic aortic endografts. Patients who underwent EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm from August 2010 to November 2016 were identified from the registry. The incidence and outcome of patients with lower extremity ischemia and endograft limb occlusion were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors associated with lower extremity ischemia. Results: Among the 3649 patients who were treated with the Excluder and C3 Excluder devices in the registry, 44 patients (1.2%) developed lower extremity ischemia, 16 patients (36%) developed endograft limb occlusion, and 25 patients had common femoral, femoral popliteal, or distal thrombosis. The incidence of endograft‐related limb ischemia was 0.4%. All patients required additional procedures for revascularization, and none require major extremity amputation. Patients who developed extremity ischemia were significantly younger, more likely to be female, had history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and had smaller distal limb diameter (Table). In multivariable analysis, female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52‐5.52; P =.001), younger age (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93‐0.99; P =.018), and history of PVD (OR, 5.96; 95% CI, 3.24‐10.99; P <.001) were associated with lower extremity ischemia. Conclusions: The incidences of lower extremity ischemia and endograft limb occlusion in real‐world practice are uncommon with the Excluder endograft. Female gender, younger age, and history of PVD were factors associated with lower extremity ischemia after EVAR.

AB: Background: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in young patients (pts) is traditionally considered at poor prognosis. Although current guidelines recommend endocrine therapy (ET) as first line treatment (1st trt) for HR+ HER2‐ MBC, younger age can lead to more extensive use of first line chemotherapy (CT). In the present analysis, we aimed to assess overall survival (OS) of younger MBC pts compared to older ones, and to explore 1st trt choices in a large real‐life multicenter cohort. Methods: The Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics (ESME) Research program aims to collect high‐quality real‐world data in oncology from 18 French Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Pts who started treatment for a newly diagnosed MBC between Jan 2008 and Dec 2014 were selected in the MBC ESME database. The primary end point of the FICHE‐Young study was to compare adjusted OS in pts diagnosed with endocrine‐sensitive HR+ HER2‐ MBC and aged ≤ 45 vs>45 at diagnosis. We also evaluated 1st trt choices in both categories and its correlation with OS. Analyses will be adjusted on a propensity score, in order to control selection biases associated with non‐randomization. Results: 6265 pts out of 16703 in ESME had HR+/HER2‐ MBC. Characteristics and 1st trt choices are listed in the Table. Median OS was 62.3 months (mos) (95% CI 56.5‐69) in pts ≤ 45 and 52.8 mos in those >45 (95% CI 50.7‐55), p<.0001. In pts ≤ 45, we did not show any statistically significant difference in OS between first line ET and CT+/‐ ET (68.5 mos for ET (95% CI, 56.8‐NE) vs 59.0 mos for CT+/‐ET (95% CI, 55.9‐69), p=0.3208). Conclusions: With the limitations of a nonrandomized study population, in this realworld setting, younger HR+MBC pts did not show a poorer prognosis compared to older patients. Many young pts received CT as first line treatment, with no demonstrated benefit over ET alone.

AB: Purpose: Limited data exist on the use of statins in Chinese patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We therefore conducted this study to observe the usage trend and the effectiveness of statins on LDL‐C goal attainment and other lipid parameters among PCI‐treated patients. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study was conducted in PCI‐treated patients with CAD between July 1, 2011, and February 28, 2015. Primary study outcomes included statin treatment pattern after PCI and proportion of patients achieving target (LDL‐C) levels 1 month after PCI and initiating statin therapy. Findings: Data were analyzed for 2708 patients (mean age, 59 [10] years; median body mass index, 25.6 [4.0] kg/m2). From baseline to the end of 1 month, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were the most prescribed statins; 20 mg and 10 mg were the most prescribed doses and therefore chosen for efficacy comparisons. In patients without dose changes, LDL‐C reduction with rosuvastatin 10 mg was significantly greater compared with atorvastatin 20 mg (‐0.67 mmol/L [from 2.44 mmol/L to 1.77 mmol/L] vs ‐0.54 mmol/L [from 2.40 mmol/L to 1.86 mmol/L]; P = 0.008). However, there was no difference in HDL‐C, triglyceride, or total cholesterol values between groups. Age and LDL‐C levels at baseline were significantly associated with target LDL‐C achievement. Implications: In real‐world, PCI‐treated Chinese patients, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were the most prescribed statins. Compared with atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg was associated with greater LDL‐C reductions and achievement of LDL‐C targets in a higher percentage of patients. This analysis of real‐world data shows that both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were well tolerated and seemed to be suitable drugs for controlling lipid levels and preventing CVD risk in post‐PCI Chinese patients with CAD.

AB: Objectives: Chronic spontaneous/idiopathic urticaria (CSU/CIU) can significantly impact patients' lives when inadequately controlled. Real‐world data on health status and utility values for CSU are unavailable. The present analysis reports EQ‐5D health status from the ASSURE‐CSU study. Methods: ASSURE‐CSU is an observational study, which included a 1‐year retrospective medical record abstraction, a cross‐sectional patient‐reported survey, and a 7‐day prospective patient diary. Adult patients with symptomatic disease despite treatment were recruited in 7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom). Patients completed twice‐daily Urticaria Activity Score summed over 7 days (UAS7TD), used to define disease activity categories: score 0 (urticaria‐free), 1‐6 (well‐controlled urticaria), 7‐15 (mild), 16‐27 (moderate), and 28‐42 (severe). The EQ‐5D‐3L is a standardised, preference‐based measure of health status comprised of five domains (mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/ depression), scored on a scale of 1 to 3 (no to extreme problems). A single index utility value was calculated ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Pooled country data were analysed using descriptive statistics and stratified by UAS7TD categories. Results: A total of 627 patients completed EQ‐5D. The mean (SD) EQ‐5D utility score estimate was 0.714 (0.2907). Mean (SD) utility decreased as UAS7TD disease activity increased: 0.826 (0.2147), 0.758 (0.2524), 0.674 (0.3077), and 0.601 (0.3423) for urticaria‐free/well‐controlled, mild, moderate, and severe urticaria respectively. Pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were the most frequently affected domains, with patients reporting moderate (52.2% and 39.2%, respectively) and extreme (11.0% and 8.2%, respectively) problems. The percentage of patients reporting moderate or extreme problems was higher on all five domains among those with high activity. Conclusions: Patients with increasing activity of CSU had a consistent decrease in utility scores, reflecting a lower QoL. Patients reported complaints related to pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Utility values reported in real‐world are consistent with those recently published from omalizumab in CSU phase III trials.

AB: Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. The safety profile of this new drug is primarily limited to data published in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The objective of our study was to estimate the real‐world safety and incidence of adverse events (AEs) leading to withdrawal of apremilast in the treatment of psoriasis, and to compare these findings with RCT results. A multicentre retrospective chart review was conducted, which captured all patients treated with apremilast from November 2014 to July 2017. Patients were permitted to use concurrent therapies with apremilast. Outcome measurements included the proportion of patients reporting at least AE and the incidence proportion of AEs leading to withdrawal while taking apremilast during the first 16 weeks of treatment. Real‐world data were compared with RCT data using Pearson's v2‐test (P ≤ 0.01 considered significant). After screening, 208 patients were included in the analysis. A smaller proportion of real‐world patients experienced at least one AE compared with RCT patients (real world 122 of 208, 58.7%; RCT 573 of 832, 68.9%; P = 0.005). A greater proportion of real‐world patients discontinued apremilast due to AEs compared with RCT patients (real world 39 of 208, 18.8%; RCT 44 of 832, 5.3%; P < 0.001). Patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs reported experiencing an average of 2.1 ± 1.2 AEs leading to withdrawal (range one to five). Of the 122 patients who experienced an AE during the first 16 weeks of treatment, 32.0% went on to withdraw from treatment due to AEs, and the average time elapsed before withdrawal was 1.7 ± 1.0 months. The most commonly reported AEs leading to withdrawal included diarrhoea (11 of 208, 5.3%), nausea (10 of 208, 4.8%), headache (nine of 208, 4.3%), nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (seven of 208, 3.4%), abdominal pain (five of 208, 2.4%), fatigue (four of 208, 1.9%) and allergic reaction (three of 208, 1.4%). There were no reports of tuberculosis reactivation or onset of malignancy leading to withdrawal. In summary, apremilast is generally a safe medication for the treatment of psoriasis in the real‐world setting, with AEs being reported in similar proportions to RCTs. However, the proportion of AEs associated with withdrawal in clinical practice is greater than that reported in RCTs. The retrospective nature of the study limits the generalizability of the findings.

AB: Background: The use of combined therapy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant versus anticoagulant alone to reduce instances of thromboembolic events in patients with heart valve prostheses is an established standard of care in many countries but not in Egypt. A previous Markov model cost‐effectiveness study on Egyptian patients aged 50‐60 years demonstrated that the combined therapy reduces the overall treatment cost. However, due to the lack of actual real‐world data on cost‐effectiveness and the limitation of the Markov model study to 50‐ to 60‐year‐old patients, the Egyptian medical community is still questioning whether the added benefit is worth the cost. Objective: To assess, from the perspective of the Egyptian health sector, the cost‐effectiveness of the combined use of warfarin and low‐dose aspirin (75 mg) versus that of warfarin alone in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses who began therapy between the age of 15 and 50 years. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized, controlled trial to assess the cost‐effectiveness of the combined therapy in patients with mechanical valve prostheses. A total of 316 patients aged between 15 and 50 years were included in the study and randomly assigned to a group treated with both warfarin and aspirin or a group treated with warfarin alone. Results: The patients in the combined therapy group exhibited a significantly longer duration of protection against the first event. Fewer primary events were observed in the patients treated with warfarin plus aspirin than in those treated with warfarin alone (1.4 %/year, vs. 4.8 %/year), and a higher mean quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) value over 4 years was obtained for the group treated with warfarin plus aspirin (difference 0.058; 95 % CI 0.013‐0.118), although this difference did not reach a conventional level of statistical significance. The total costs over a 4‐year period were lower with the combined therapy (difference ‐US$244; 95 % CI ‐US$483.1 to ‐US$3.8), which yielded an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of ‐US$4206 per QALY gained. Thus, the combined therapy was dominant. All costs were reported in US dollars (USD) for the financial year 2014. Conclusions: The results of this analysis indicate that from the perspective of the Egyptian health sector, the addition of aspirin to the typical warfarin therapy is more effective and less costly for patients with mechanical valve prostheses than treatment with warfarin alone. This combined strategy could be adopted to prevent the complications of mechanical valve prostheses. Our study adds to the body of evidence supporting the option of warfarin‐plus‐aspirin therapy for patients with mechanical valve prostheses.

AB: Introduction: The FEIBA GO study was designed to capture long‐term outcomes on effectiveness, safety and quality of life in subjects receiving FEIBA in different settings in routine clinical practice. The primary objective is to describe the hemostatic effectiveness of FEIBA in different settings (prophylaxis and on demand, including patients on immune‐tolerance induction); most relevant secondary objectives aim at describing joint functionality outcomes, safety, health‐related quality of life, daily activity level, acute and chronic pain associated with haemophilia, as well as health resources used. Methods: The study is a prospective, noninterventional, observational multicenter cohort study in patients with hemophilia A or B and highresponding inhibitors treated with FEIBA prior the decision to enroll in the study. 100 subjects are targeted for enrollment and treatment regimens are at the discretion of the attending physicians in accordance with routine clinical practice, either in prophylaxis or on demand, including immunetolerance induction. The observation period per subject will be 4 years. Results: An initial, unplanned data read‐out was carried out on Sept 15, 2016 on 28 subjects with severe haemophilia A and inhibitors (median titer at screening 10, min‐max 1‐2,410), recruited in 14 haemophilia centres in 8 countries: median age 23 years (range 3‐71). Of 28 patients, 21 were on prophylaxis. Of these, 18 patients (data currently missing for 3) showed a median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 3.7 (ABR 0 in 16.7% of subjects; <2 in 22.3%; <3 in 39.0%), while median annualized joint bleeding rate (AJBR) was 1.6 (ABR 0 in 38.9% of subjects; ABR <2 in 55.6%; ABR <3 in 77.8%). Discussion/Conclusion: These preliminary findings show that prophylaxis with FEIBA in inhibitor patients can be extremely effective, because it demonstrably prevents joint bleeding in a number of subjects similar to that reported in non‐inhibitor patients on replacement prophylaxis. This study will further enhance the knowledge of long‐term prophylaxis in the setting of real world data by assessing effectiveness, HR‐QoL and safety of FEIBA in this rare patient population. Data read‐out information will be consolidated and expanded on for the other study endpoints in an interim analysis, which is planned for next year.

AB: Objectives: Little evidence is available on the management of patients with Advanced Gastric Cancer (AGC) after failure of 1st‐line treatment. This study presents real‐world data on patient characteristics and treatment patterns for these patients in Brazil. Methods: Data from medical charts were collected from 5 centers. Eligible patients were > 18 years old, diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic GC, between January 2011 and December 2014, had received 1st‐line chemotherapy treatment, had > 3 months of follow‐up after 1st‐line discontinuation, and had not participated in a clinical trial. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: Out of 494 charts screened, 154 were eligible (n= 98 [63.6%] from public healthcare institutions). Mean age was 61.1 years and 57.1% of patients were male; 55.2% and 18.8% progressed to second‐ and third‐line therapies, respectively. ECOG performance status (PS) during 1st‐line treatment was PS= 0 in 25.0%, PS= 1 in 59.5%, and PS= 2 in 14.7%. During 2nd‐line treatment, it was PS= 0 in 18.2%, PS= 1 in 54.6%, and PS= 2 in 25.5%. Twenty‐one and 19 different regimens were used as 1st‐ and 2nd‐line treatments, respectively. CapeOx (31; 20.1%), FOLFOX (26; 16.9%) and EOX (14; 9.1%) were the most frequent 1st‐line regimens, while irinotecan (29; 34.1%), paclitaxel (16; 18.8%) and CapeOx (5; 5.9%) prevailed in 2nd‐line treatment. Supportive care was observed among 14.5% of the patients, only after 1stline treatment. The median overall survival since AGC diagnosis was 16.9 (95%CI [13.6‐20.5]) months in all patients, and 15.0 (95% CI [12.4‐19.3]) and 20.0 (95% CI [15.4‐27.6]) months in patients from public and private institutions, respectively (p= 0.23). Conclusions: Treatment patterns for patients with AGC in Brazilian institutions are highly heterogeneous. The low rates of supportive care without active treatment warrant further study The results of this study may contribute to the development of new strategies and guidelines for AGC management in Brazil.

AB: BACKGROUND Prospective real‐world data are important to supplement clinical trial data in heterogeneous diseases like asthma. Data for adolescents are essential, as they are often under‐represented in clinical trials. METHODS 69 patients aged between 12‐17 years old with asthma, identified as omalizumab candidates by their treating physicians and with access to omalizumab through insurance or other funding, were enrolled as part of the PROSPERO study. Patients were followed for a maximum of 48 weeks. At baseline and throughout the study, asthma‐related healthcare utilization and exacerbations, were recorded. Asthma control was recorded monthly using the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Spirometry was performed and biomarkers (FeNO, blood eosinophils) were collected at baseline, 6 months and end of the study. RESULTS 59 (86%) adolescents completed 48 weeks of the study; mean (SD) age 14.0 (1.69) years, primarily male (64%) and white (58%), with 33% Black or African American. On average, adolescents reported 2.8 exacerbations (67% with >= 2 exacerbations) that required oral corticosteroid use, ED visit or hospitalization in the 12 months prior to enrollment. 28% reported >= 1 asthma related hospitalization in the prior year. At month 12, a mean rate of 0.46 exacerbations per year was observed, representing an 84% reduction from baseline. 11.5% of patients reported >= 2 exacerbations and 4% reported >= 1 hospitalization, an 83% and 86% reduction from baseline. Mean (SD) baseline FEV1 percentage predicted was 88% (17) and improved on average by 8% to 95% (20), an absolute improvement of 160mLs compared with baseline. 71.6% (48/67) of adolescent patients with baseline ACT data reported poorly controlled asthma at baseline based on ACT score of <20. At the study's conclusion, 68.8% of these poorly controlled patients were controlled (ACT >= 20). Baseline mean (SD) FeNO levels were 38.4 (39.4) ppb and mean (SD) eosinophils were 316 (210) cells/muL, with 54.5% of patients having eosinophils <= 300 cells/muL. Median (interquartile range) total IgE levels were 507 (960.7) IU/mL. At the end of study, mean (SD) FeNO levels decreased by 27% to 29.2 (28.1) ppb and mean eosinophils (SD) decreased by 34% to 209 (151) cells/muL. Adverse events were consistent with the safety profile described in the current product label. CONCLUSIONS In a real‐world setting, adolescents treated with omalizumab had significant improvements in asthma control as demonstrated by decreased exacerbations and hospitalizations, and improved ACT scores compared with baseline.

AB: Introduction: Most randomized controlled trials (RCT) implementhighly specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, which results in astudy population that only represents of subset of the patients that willultimately be treated with the device under its approved indications.Therefore, increased focus has been put on the use of 'real‐world'data to support RCT evidence for clinical decision‐making. Theobjective of this study was to assess the performance of an annularclosure device (ACD) in a consecutive series of 'real‐world' patientsthat have been retrospectively stratified according to the screeningcriteria of an on‐going RCT.Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of single‐centerprospective registry including 164 subjects with a large annular defect(C 6 mm width) who underwent limited discectomy augmented bythe ACD for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. Patients werestratified into two unique groups using the selection criteria of thepivotal RCT on the same device: Trial (met inclusion criteria; n = 44)or non‐Trial (did not meet inclusion criteria; n = 120). Key RCT inclusion criteria, beyond the large defect criterion, were: leg paingraded on the visual analog scale (VAS) higher than 40/100, dysfunction graded on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) greater than40/100, no prior herniation at the index level, and a minimum posterior disc height of 5 mm. Patient reported outcomes included ODIscores and VAS for leg and back pain scores. Adverse events werecollected from baseline to last follow‐up (mean: Trial‐15.6 months;non‐Trial‐14.6 months). Statistical analyses were performed withsignificance set at p< 0.05.Results: Patient reported outcomes were not significantly differentbetween groups at last follow‐up (p C 0.15) and clinical success(C 15‐point improvement in ODI score; C 20‐point improvement inVAS scores) was achieved in both groups at similar frequencies(Table 1). Three non‐Trial (2.5%) and three Trial (6.8%) patientsexperienced symptomatic reherniation (p = 0.34). The rates of reoperation, ACD mesh dislocation/separation, and other radiographicfindings were also similar between groups (p = 1.00).Conclusion: Outcomes with the ACD were advantageous in bothgroups, particularly in comparison to historical reherniation ratesreported in the same high‐risk, large annular defect population.Stratification of this 'real‐world' series on the basis of RCT screeningcriteria did not result in significant between‐group differences in thisLevel II study. This observations supports the efficacy of annularclosure in large defect patients beyond the stringent criteria of thisRCT. Reducing the reherniation rate following lumbar discectomy inthis high‐risk population has positive clinical and economic implications. The methods used in this study can be leveraged by otherinvestigators to determine if stratification of their patient series produces similar results.

AB: Objective: The efficacy of catheter‐based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) in terms of blood pressure (BP) reduction has been questioned, while "real‐world" data from registries are needed. In the present study we report the complete set of 12 month data on office and ambulatory BP changes as well as the predictors for BP response to RDN from a national registry. Design and method: In 4 Greek hospital centers 79 patients with severe drug resistant hypertension (age: 59 +/‐ 10 years, 53 males, body mass index: 33 +/‐ 5 kg/ m2, office BP and 24‐hour ambulatory BP were 176 +/‐ 15/95 +/‐ 13 mmHg and 155 +/‐ 14/90 +/‐ 12 mmHg respectively, 4.4 +/‐ 0.9 antihypertensive drugs) underwent RDN and were followed‐up for 12 months in the Greek Renal Denervation Registry. Bilateral RDN was performed using percutaneous femoral approach and standardized techniques. Results: Reduction in office systolic/diastolic BP at 6 and 12 months from baseline was ‐30/‐12 mmHg and ‐29/‐12 mmHg, while the reduction in 24‐hour ambulatory BP was ‐16/‐9 mmHg and ‐15/‐9 mmHg respectively (p < 0.05 for all). Patients that were RDN responders (85%, n = 58), defined as an at least 10 mmHg decrease in office systolic BP at 12 months, compared to nonresponders were younger (57 +/‐ 9 vs 65 +/‐ 8 years, p < 0.05), had higher baseline office systolic BP (176 +/‐ 17 vs 160 +/‐ 11 mmHg, p < 0.05) and 24 h systolic BP (159 +/‐ 13 vs 149 +/‐ 11 mmHg, p < 0.05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that age, obesity parameters and baseline office BP were independent predictors of RDN response (p < 0.05 for both), but not the type of RDN catheter or the use of aldosterone antagonists. At 12 months there were no significant changes in renal function and no new serious device or procedure related adverse events. Conclusions: In our "real‐world" multicenter national registry, the efficacy of renal denervation in reducing BP as well as safety is confirmed during a 12 months follow‐up. Moreover, younger age, obesity and higher levels of baseline systolic BP are independently related to better BP response to RDN.

AB: Background: In the BOND trial (Cunningham et al, NEJM 2004) for refractory mCRC, the addition of I to an EGFR antibody improved tumor response rate and time to progression but not overall survival (OS). We assessed the “real world” efficacy and toxicity of combination versus monotherapy in i) all‐comers and ii) older patients ( pts) who are under‐represented in randomized trials. Methods: In Ontario, universal public funding is available for either Cmab + I combination or Pmab monotherapy only in pts with refractory non‐mutated Kras mCRC. All pts diagnosed before Dec 2012 and treated with an EGFR antibody for mCRC were identified from the Ontario drug database and linked to the Ontario Cancer Registry and other administrative databases to ascertain baseline characteristics, health services utilization and outcomes. Multivariable Cox and logistic models were constructed to compare the time to treatment discontinuation, overall survival (OS), ED or hospital visits between Cmab + I and Pmab, adjusting for observable confounders (including age, gender, year of diagnosis, stage at presentation, duration of prior treatment in 1st and 2nd line, previous liver resection, rural residence and income quintile) using propensity score methods. Results: 1081 pts were identified (Cmab + I: 278, Pmab: 803); median age: 60 (21.1% >age 70), 36.4% female, 36.2% rectal cancer and 60.1% stage IV at presentation. After adjusting for confounders, the use of Cmab + I as compared to Pmab alone was associated with a prolonged time to treatment discontinuation [median: 3.5 mos vs. 2.8 mos, HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.53‐0.75, p < 0.001]and an improved OS compared to Pmab alone [median: 8.8 mos vs. 5.9 mos, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.53‐0.73, p < 0.001]. Both had similar 14‐day mortality and incidence of ED or hospital visits. Interaction tests of treatment effect and age were >0.05. Conclusions: “Real world” data suggest a possible OS benefit with Cmab + I compared to Pmab alone, without an associated increase in toxicity. Pts age ≥70 appear to experience similar benefit and toxicity from combination therapy. These results suggest a need for adequately powered randomized trials to compare Cmab + I and Pmab like the ongoing ICECREAM study.

DOI: 10.1111/jgh.13516
AB: Introduction: SSA/Ps account for up to 30% of sporadic colorectal cancers. They are reported to be more frequent in the proximal colon and endoscopic recognition is often difficult because of their flat morphology and indistinct borders. In screened populations, serrated polyps account for up to 12.1% by WHO criteria, and 14.7% by expert pathologists, of all detected polyps. We have previously reported the prevalence of SSA/ Ps in FOBT positive patients in an academic institution (Lim A et al, J Gastroenterol Hepatol 2015). In this study, SSA/Ps accounted for 7.7% of all polyps. 'Real world' data relating to private practice are lacking. Our study evaluated the detection of this potentially under‐recognized entity in patients referred to private practice, who had colonoscopy performed at both rural and urban centers. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted for patients who underwent their index colonoscopy from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 at three private hospitals and one rural hospital in South Australia. All patients were asymptomatic and had a positive fecal immunochemical test initiated either by their general practitioners or through National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. Demographic data, adequacy of bowel preparation, number, location, and histologic findings of polyps were recorded. Results: One hundred twelve patients (59 male, mean age 54 years) were included. Three patients had poor bowel preparation. A total of 244 polyps were found in 90 patients. The majority (66.0%) of these polyps were left sided. Adenomatous polyps were found in 52 patients (46.4%), while hyperplastic polyps were seen in 49 (43.7%). Three (2.6%) patients were found to have adenocarcinoma, and 1 had a leiomyoma of the colon. Only four patients (3.5%) had single SSA/Ps, all of which were less than 10mm in size. (Table presented) Conclusions: Within the constraints of a small sample size, our analysis showed that the prevalence of SSA/Ps in FOBT positive patients who undergo colonoscopy in private practice settings may be lower than that reported in the literature, including our own previously reported series. The reasons for this are not clear and were not specifically investigated in this study. More data are needed to confirm this observation.

AB: Background: Previous studies using incomplete trial inclusion and exclusion criteria suggest a difference between the reported effectiveness and safety of biologic therapies between randomised clinical trials (RCT) and real‐world populations of patients with psoriasis. Objectives: To estimate the difference in safety and effectiveness outcomes in biologic therapies for psoriasis between the trial and real‐world populations using a standardisation method.Methods: Data from patients on etanercept, adalimumab, or ustekinumab in the British Association of Dermatologists Biologic Interventions Register (BADBIR) were appended to individual participant‐level data from two RCTs assessing ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis, PHOENIX 1 and 2. Baseline patient variables were assessed for association of being in a RCT using a multivariate logistic regression model. Propensity score based standardized mortality ratio weights were derived to reweigh the registry sample so that all variables had the distribution seen in the trial sample. The incidence rate of SAEs in the first year and the proportion of patients achieving an absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) <1.5 at 6 months were calculated in the BADBIR cohort before and after weighting, with 95% confidence intervals calculated using bootstrapping.Results: 6790 registry and 2021 trial participants were included. There were marked differences in the baseline co‐variates between the registry and trial participants, and the multivariate logistic model had a C‐statistic of 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.83, 0.84). All variables had a standardised difference between‐0.1 and 0.1 after weighting. The incidence rate difference of SAEs between the registry and trial sample was 9.30 (95% CI‐3.91, 22.50) per 1000 person‐years the incidence rate ratio was 1.14 (95% CI 0.91, 1.37). The difference in proportion achieving absolute PASI < 1.5 between the registry and trial sample was 1.09% (95% CI‐1.98%, 4.15%) the relative risk ratio was 1.03 (95% CI 0.94, 1.11). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the difference between the baseline characteristics of a real‐world and a trial psoriasis population leads to the underestimation of the true real‐world incidence of SAEs, but not effectiveness, in psoriasis clinical trials. Real‐world data are therefore needed to understand the true safety of biologic therapies in psoriasis.

AB: Background: Randomized trials demonstrated a lower risk of cardiovascular (CV) events with sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT‐2i) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high CV risk. Prior real‐world data suggested similar SGLT‐2i effects in T2D patients with a broader risk profile, but these studies focused on heart failure and death and were limited to the United States and Europe. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine a broad range of CV outcomes in patients initiated on SGLT‐2i versus other glucose‐lowering drugs (oGLDs) across 6 countries in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and North American regions. Methods: New users of SGLT‐2i and oGLDs were identified via claims, medical records, and national registries in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Israel, Australia, and Canada. Propensity scores for SGLT‐2i initiation were developed in each country, with 1:1 matching. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), death or HHF, MI, and stroke were assessed by country and pooled using weighted meta‐analysis. Results: After propensity‐matching, there were 235,064 episodes of treatment initiation in each group; ~27% had established CV disease. Patient characteristics were well‐balanced between groups. Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin, canagliflozin, tofogliflozin, and luseogliflozin accounted for 75%, 9%, 8%, 4%, 3%, and 1% of exposure time in the SGLT‐2i group, respectively. Use of SGLT‐2i versus oGLDs was associated with a lower risk of death (HR: 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 0.70; p < 0.001), HHF (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.82; p = 0.001), death or HHF (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.76; p < 0.001), MI (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.88; p < 0.001), and stroke (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.84; p < 0.001). Results were directionally consistent across both countries and patient subgroups, including those with and without CV disease. Conclusions: In this large, international study of patients with T2D from the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and North America, initiation of SGLT‐2i was associated with a lower risk of CV events across a broad range of outcomes and patient characteristics.

AB: Purpose: Outcomes of eyes with good vision (>6/12, >70 ETDRS letters) were not evaluated in the pivotal trials for ranibizumab. We evaluated the effectiveness, and cost‐effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab in patients with neovascular AMD (nAMD) with good starting visual acuity using real‐world outcomes data. Methods: Anonymised structured data were collected from 14 centers using an EMR system. The primary outcome was the mean VA at year 1, 2, and 3. Secondary measures included the number of clinic visits and injections. A patient‐level health economic state transition model based on levels of visual acuity in the better seeing eye was constructed to simulate the costs and consequences of treating nAMD patients. In the model two treatment approaches were compared: immediate intervention with ranibizumab PRN (on detection of nAMD) or delayed intervention (wait until vision fell to 6/12 before beginning treatment). Results: The study included 12,951 treatment‐naive eyes of 11,135 patients receiving 92,976 ranibizumab treatments. A total of 754 patients had baseline VA better than 6/12 and at least one‐year of follow up. Mean VA of first treated eyes with baseline VA > 6/12 at year 1, 2, 3 were 6/10, 6/12, 6/15, respectively and those with baseline VA 6/12 to > 6/24 were 6/15, 6/17, 6/20, respectively (p‐values <0.001 for comparing differences between 6/12 and 6/12‐6/24 groups). For the second eyes with baseline VA > 6/12, mean VA at year 1, 2, 3 were 6/9, 6/9, 6/10, and those with baseline VA 6/12 to > 6/24 were 6/15, 6/15, 6/27, respectively (p‐values <0.001‐ 0.005). There was no significant difference in average number of clinic visits or injections between those with VA better or worse than 6/12. Over a two‐year time horizon, based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the early treatment arm accumulated 1.59 QALYs and 8,469.79 cost. The delayed treatment arm accumulated 1.35 QALYs and 7,460.21 cost. The ICER was 4,251.60. Conclusions: Eyes with baseline VA > 6/12 maintained better mean VA than the eyes with baseline VA 6/12 to > 6/24 at all time points for at least 2 years. An economic model based on real‐world data is likely to be a realistic reflection of the health gains and resource use of ranibizumab for nAMD. Initiating treatment immediately in eyes with good vision with ranibizumab is a cost effective strategy.

AB: Purpose LUMINOUS (NCT01318941, initiated March 2011) is the largest prospective observational global study in the field of medical retina. The study is designed to evaluate the long‐term safety, e ectiveness, treatment patterns, and health‐related quality‐of‐life associated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment, across all approved indications, in 30,000 patients from routine clinical practice. We present data from the 2014 interim analysis. Methods This interim analysis included 3 cohorts: Cohort 1, baseline characteristics of patients enrolled before March 2014 (N=20,085; nAMD, n=17,546; DME, n=1,758; BRVO, n=393; CRVO, n=350); Cohort 2, patients with potential for 1‐year follow‐up enrolled before March 2013 (N=9790; nAMD, n=9125; DME, n=427; BRVO, n=119; CRVO, n=119); and Cohort 3, patients with potential for 2‐year follow‐up enrolled before March 2012 (nAMD, N=2001). Results Cohort 1: LUMINOUS included patients with diverse demographics and baseline characteristics (Table 1). Across all indications, mean baseline visual acuity (VA, ETDRS letters) was higher in patients previously treated with ranibizumab (56.5) than in treatmentnaive patients (49.3). Cohort 2: The 1‐year data showed that on average treatment‐naive patients gained VA from baseline whilst those previously treated with ranibizumab either gained or maintained VA. These outcomes were obtained with a relatively low number of injections and visits (Table 2). In nAMD, VA was maintained at 1‐year even in those patients who were previously treated with ranibizumab for >=6 years. Cohort 3: At Year 2, there was a mean increase in VA of 2.0 ETDRS letters from a baseline VA of 54.9 ETDRS letters in treatment naive patients whilst those previously treated with ranibizumab lost 3.0 ETDRS letters of VA from a higher baseline of 60.4 ETDRS letters. At Year 1 (Cohort 2) and Year 2 (Cohort 3), the rates of ocular and non‐ocular serious adverse events were 0.54/0.70% and 6.52/13.34%, respectively. Conclusions This interim analysis of LUMINOUS study data reinforces the well‐established effcacy and safety profile of ranibizumab in a real‐world clinical setting. LUMINOUS will provide an invaluable source of long‐term real‐world data.

AB: Introduction: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown cause with a 2‐4 year median survival rate. Nintedanib has been shown to slow disease progression in IPF patients. It was licensed in the UK in January 2016. Aim: To report real world data about our early clinical experience using nintedanib in IPF patients prior to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval, in a manufacturer funded patient in need scheme (December 2014‐January 2016). Methods: All IPF patients seen at 3 UK centres commenced on nintedanib. Demographic details, adverse events (AEs) and where available lung function results were retrospectively collected from clinical letters. Data is presented as median+/‐standard deviation(range). Results: We identified 187 patients (76% males) with a median age of 72 years+/‐8(49‐89). The average pre‐treatment FVC was 81.1%+/‐19.8(35‐135) and DLCO was 43.9%+/‐15(13‐78) predicted for patients at University Hospital of South Manchester (UHSM). Fifty percent of patients started nintedanib because they were ineligible for pirfenidone due to a predicted FVC>80%. Other reasons included intolerable AEs on pirfenidone in 38 patients(20%), refusing pirfenidone based on AE profile in 32 patients(17%) and an FVC<50% predicted in 12 patients(6%). The median treatment course was 8+/‐4 months. The majority of patients experienced 1‐3 AEs with nintedanib(52%,n=97) whilst 18% experienced no AEs(n=33). The most frequent AEs were diarrhoea(50%),nausea(36%),reduced appetite(24%),tiredness(20%) and gastro‐oesophageal reflux(GOR)(18%). The majority of AEs resulted in no change in treatment(64%, n=461). In 21%(n=150) there was a dose reduction and only 13%(n=94) of all AEs necessitated treatment discontinuation. 8% of diarrhoea AEs led to treatment discontinuation. 1 in 5 patients discontinued treatment either on a temporary or permanent basis. In a select cohort of patients we can demonstrate a statistically significant proportion of patients remaining stable or improving and a lower proportion declining, as depicted by FVC changes of >5% after starting nintedanib (p<0.05 using Chi squared test). Conclusions: Nintedanib is well tolerated by IPF patients and has an acceptable safety profile. We did not experience any signals in respect to increased cardiovascular morbidity or bleeding risk. Despite limitations of our lung function data, we show a greater proportion of patients remain stable or improve, and less decline after nintedanib treatment. This is similar to the findings of the INPULSIS clinical trials.

DOI: 10.1007/s00125-014-3355-0
AB: Background and aims: Despite the efficacy of basal insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), many patients do not reach glycaemic goals. Here we use both randomized clinical trial (RCT) data and “real‐world” data from a retrospective study of electronic medical records (EMR) to assess the characteristics of T2DM patients who do not achieve target glycaemic control while on basal insulin (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%) in order to better understand the clinical characteristics of these patients. Materials and methods: Patients with T2DM aged ≥ 18 years treated with basal insulin, but with HbA1c ≥ 7.0% were identified by analysing results from 11 RCTs at 6 months after the index date, defined as date of first prescription for basal insulin, and results from the GE Centricity EMR database at 6‐months and at 12‐months follow‐up after the index date. Patients were stratified based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (< 130 or ≥ 130 mg/ dL). Information on patient demographic and clinical characteristics were available from both sources of data. Results: The table shows that in the RCTs around 52% achieved HbA1c < 7.0% (recommended by the ADA for most diabetic patients). HbA1c < 7.0% was achieved by fewer patients (∼27%) in the EMR database at both 6 and 12 months. Among those with HbA1c ≥ 7.0%, 54.9% of RCT patients and 17.6% and 27.7% of EMR patients at 6 and 12 months, respectively, had FPG < 130 mg/dL. About half of the RCT patients not achieving goal had a FPG ≥ 130 mg/dL. This suggested that these patients needed further basal insulin titration, whereas patients at goal likely required postprandial glucose control. In the EMR cohort, > 70% of patients were likely to need additional basal insulin titration. Conclusion: Failure to adequately titrate basal insulin is an unmet need in many T2DM patients, which is evident even in RCTs. When basal insulin is adequately titrated and FPG is controlled, additional postprandial treatment may be needed. Another important unmet need is understanding the causes of failure to achieve control of FPG with basal insulin. (Table Presented).

AB: Background: Trastuzumab (TRA) was approved for HER2‐positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (mGC) in China in August 2012. However, real‐world data on the treatment patterns, effectiveness, and safety of TRA in Chinese patients (pts) with mGC are limited. Methods: EVIDENCE is a prospective, multicenter, non‐interventional, registry study of 5 cohorts (NCT01839500). Cohort I enrolled pts with HER2‐positive mGC (IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) diagnosed up to 6 months previously. This interim analysis evaluated the effectiveness and safety of TRA in the first 95 pts of cohort I who were treated at 33 hospitals in China between April 2013 and August 15, 2016. Results: 71 of the 95 pts (74.7%) were male and the median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range 21‐87 years). At the data cut‐off date, the preliminary median PFS was 9.5 months (95% CI 7.6‐11.8 months), and the preliminary median overall survival (OS) was 30.0 months (95% CI 18.6‐38.7 months). 90 pts were treated with TRA + chemotherapy; XELOX (capecitabine + oxaliplatin) (28 pts, 31.1%) and capecitabine (20 pts, 22.2%) were the mostly commonly used regimens with TRA for first‐line therapy, while paclitaxel was most commonly used with TRA for second‐line (7.8%) and third‐line (2.2%) therapy. TRA was also used in neoadjuvant (7 pts) and adjuvant (8 pts) settings prior to recurrence. During follow‐up, 48 pts had progressive disease, and 21 (43.8%) received TRA beyond progression; 7 pts (14.6%) continued TRA after their 2nd disease progression. TRA‐related adverse events (AEs) were observed in 26 pts (27.4%), including neutropenia in 10 pts (10.5%), thrombocytopenia in 9 (9.5%), and a decreased white blood cell count in 7 (7.4%). Only 6 pts (6.3%) experienced grade > = 3 TRA‐related AEs (which included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). Conclusions: In routine clinical practice in China, TRA combined with various chemotherapy regimens proved effective and well tolerated for treating mGC HER2+ pts. In addition to its use in palliative settings, TRA was also used as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment.

AB: Objectives: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis often require Vitamin D receptor agonists (VDRAs) therapy for managing secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). In a post‐hoc analysis, the oral phosphate binder sucroferric oxyhydroxide (SFOH) had no apparent interaction with oral VDRAs. In contrast, the widely used oral phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate (SEV) showed potential interactions with oral VDRAs but no interactions with intravenous (IV) VDRAs. A cost minimization analysis (CMA) estimated the economic impact of using SFOH vs SEV in dialysis patients receiving VDRA agents in six European countries. Methods: The CMA assumed similar efficacy for SFOH and SEV, and that patients received either SFOH (1.5 g/day [3 tablets/day]) and oral VDRAs (0.28 mu g/day) or SEV (6.4 g/ day [8 tablets/day]) and IV VDRAs (1.84 mu g/day or 200 IC/day). SFOH and SEV dosage was derived from two phase 3 trials (NCT01324128/NCT01464190). Drug acquisition costs were based on list ex‐manufacturer prices. Costs for the administration of IV VDRAs and treatment of adverse events were not included. Results: Annual treatment cost per patient for SFOH and (SEV) were: Austria 1,963 ( 1,673), France 1,584 ( 1,683), Germany 1,825 ( 1,683), Italy 2,068 ( 1,518), Switzerland 3,253 ( 3,370); UK 2,872 ( 3,270). Annual treatment costs per patient for oral and (IV) VDRAs were: Austria: 113 ( 1,960), France: 88 ( 2,649), Germany: 158 ( 2,057), Italy: 32 ( 1,791), Switzerland: 113 ( 2,988) and UK: 192 ( 1,465). SFOH treatment with oral VDRAs resulted in annual cost savings per patient compared to SEV with IV VDRAs: Austria: 1,556, France: 2,661, Germany: 1,757, Italy: 1,208, Switzerland: 2,993, UK: 1,671. The magnitude of the results was confirmed in sensitivity and scenario analyses. Conclusions: The CMA suggests that cost savings could be generated by using SFOH instead of SEV and, in consequence allowing SFOH patients to use oral VDRAs and avoid more costly IV VDRAs. Real‐world data are needed to confirm these findings.

AB: Real‐world data on diabetes mellitus (DM) in Brazil is scarce. We aimed to describe the proportion of T1DM and T2DM patients with HbA1c < 7.0%, their socio‐demographic and clinical characteristics and the therapeutic strategies adopted in Brazil. This was an observational, cross‐sectional study, conducted between January and June 2016 in 250 public and private healthcare centers, randomly selected across Brazil. Overall, 2221 patients (49.1% female) were included, of which 151 (6.8%) had T1DM and 2070 (93.2%) had T2DM. Most T1DM patients (48.3%) are in the 18‐30 age group and most of T2DM patients (28.5%) are in the 61‐70 age group. BMI > 30 was found for 7.4% of T1DM patients and for 38.1% of T2DM patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 21.2 (SD 14.2) years for T1DM and 50.8 years for T2DM. Most patients (77.5%) are followed in the private healthcare sector. HbA1c < 7.0% was found for 38.2% of T1DM patients and for 51.3% of T2DM patients. Among T1DM patients, 32.5% (n=49) were using NPH, 53.6% (n=81) were using long‐acting insulin analogues, 18.5% (n=28) were using regular insulin, 53.0% (n=80) were using fast‐acting insulin analogues, and 7.9% (n=12) were using premixed insulin. Among T2DM patients, 14.9% (n=248) were insulin‐treated, of which 64.5% (n=160) with NPH, 29.4% (n=73) with long‐acting insulin analogues and 7.3% (n=18) with premixed insulin. As for oral antidiabetics, the most commonly used by T2DM patients are metformin (n=1131; 67.9%), followed by DDP‐4 inhibitors (n=584; 35.1%) and sulfonylureas (n=520; 30.1%). On average, patients attend 3.7 appointments per year for diabetes management (T1DM: 4.3; T2DM: 3.6). In this cohort of adult DM patients, a high proportion of patients with HbA1c < 7.0% was found. Insulin analogues are broadly used among this cohort patients and a high proportion of T2DM patients receive DPP‐4 inhibitors. Our findings may be explained by the fact that most are being followed in private healthcare centers. This study offers valuable insight into DM's epidemiology and management in Brazil.

AB: Introduction: PwHA have high disease burden, requiring frequent IV infusions of factor replacement. A global NIS (NCT02476942) prospectively assessed real‐world data (RWD) on bleed rates and treatment approaches in PwHA to support clinical development of emicizumab, a subcutaneously administered, bispecific monoclonal antibody for bleed prevention. After the NIS, participants (pts) could enter a phase 3 emicizumab study. We describe bleed and safety outcomes in PwHA without (wo) inhibitors on FVIII therapy per routine clinical practice (NIS Cohort C). Methods: Inclusion criteria: >=12 y.o., severe HA (FVIII activity >1%), no FVIII inhibitors, >=6 mo. of episodic or prophylactic FVIII; for episodic regimen, pts had >=5 bleeds in 6 mo. prior to study (no requirement for prophylaxis [Px]). Results: This cohort (data cutoff 31 Mar 2017) had 94 PwHA wo inhibitors on episodic (n = 45) or prophylactic (n = 49) FVIII regimens from 10 countries; median (range) age, 34 (12‐76) y.o. Median (range) observation time, 30 (12‐48) week. Most bleeds were treated (82%). Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs [95% CI]; negative binomial regression) for treated bleeds, 36.1 (30.8‐42.3) (episodic) and 5.0 (3.3‐7.5) (Px); corresponding ABRs (95% CI) for all bleeds, 43.1 (36.5‐50.9) and 6.2 (4.2‐9.2). Calculated median ABRs (IQR), 31.1 (19.8‐51.6) (episodic) and 1.9 (0‐8.22) (Px) for treated bleeds; corresponding median ABRs (IQR) for all bleeds, 35.3 (21.7‐62.9) (episodic) and 2.7 (0‐9.4) (Px). Most pts received standard half‐life FVIII (83/94 [88%]). Pts on Px had a median (IQR) 2.9 (2.1‐3.1) doses per week, and most had break‐through bleeds (31/49 [63.2%] pts, treated bleeds; 33/49 [67.3%] pts, all bleeds). Most common adverse events (AEs) were viral upper respiratory infection and arthralgia. Incidence of SAEs was low, 5 (including hemarthrosis, GI polyp bleed) in 3/49 (6.1%) pts on Px and none on episodic regimen. Discussion/Conclusion: In this real‐world setting, FVIII Px effectively controlled bleeding in PwHA wo inhibitors and ABRs were comparable to those from clinical trials. However, Px in this NIS was associated with high infusion burden and a large proportion of pts had break‐through bleeds. A high proportion of bleeds were treated, in contrast to previous RWD from this NIS in PwHA with inhibitors. These data suggest an unmet need for improved treatment options for PwHA wo inhibitors.

AB: Background: The concept of response‐guided therapy in CHC has been developed retrospectively from the results of randomised controlled trials. Prospective real‐world data testing the impact of this concept are lacking. PROPHESYS comprises three separate, non‐interventional cohort studies of patients receiving combination treatment for CHC. Data are collected only from mono‐infected, naive patients whose treatment is prescribed in accordance with the local label. According to country‐specific requirements, PROPHESYS 1 follows patients prescribed the combination of peginterferon alfa‐2a (40KD)/ribavirin. PROPHESYS 2 and 3 include combination therapy with peginterferon alfa‐2a (40KD)/ribavirin or with peginterferon alfa‐2b (12KD)/ribavirin. Methods: This interim analysis included data from patients who initiated treatment on/before 31/01/2009 and had baseline and week 12 HCV‐RNA results. RVR and cEVR were defined as undetectable HCV‐RNA (<15IU/mL) by weeks 4 and 12, respectively, and pEVR was defined as ≥2 log decrease but still detectable (≥15IU/mL) HCV‐RNA at week 12. MLR analysis explored baseline factors associated with RVR and/or cEVR. Results: A total of 5292 patients were treated with peginterferon alfa‐2a or with peginterferon alfa‐2b, both in combination with ribavirin. Baseline characteristics and on‐treatment responses are presented in the table. Among G1/4 patients, according to MLR, baseline factors significantly (p < 0.05) associated with higher rates of viral clearance by week 12 (RVR or cEVR) included younger age, lower HCV‐RNA, lower BMI, race (Asian rates higher than Caucasian, and Caucasian rates higher than Black or other), absence of cirrhosis, higher platelets, higher ALT ratio and prescription of peginterferon alfa‐2a. For G2/3 patients, factors associated with RVR and cEVR included younger age, higher platelets and genotype 3. (Table presented) Conclusion: Patient demographics differed markedly by genotype. Rates of RVR and cEVR were similar to or even higher than those reported in Phase III clinical trials. Baseline factors strongly associated with rapid and/or early viral clearance were also similar to those previously reported in randomised clinical trials. The results of this real‐world analysis provide insights into subgroups of patients who may be future candidates for shortened treatment with triple combination therapy.

AB: Cluster headache is a debilitating disease characterized by excruciatingly painful attacks that affects 0.15% to 0.4% of the US population. Episodic cluster headache manifests as circadian and circannual seasonal bouts of attacks, each lasting 15 to 180 minutes, with periods of remission. In chronic cluster headache, the attacks occur throughout the year with no periods of remission. While existing treatments are effective for some patients, many patients continue to suffer. There are only 2 FDA‐approved medications for episodic cluster headache in the United States, while others, such as high‐flow oxygen, are used off‐label. Episodic cluster headache is associated with comorbidities and affects work, productivity, and daily functioning. The economic burden of episodic cluster headache is considerable, costing more than twice that of nonheadache patients. gammaCore adjunct to standard of care (SoC) was found to have superior efficacy in treatment of acute episodic cluster headaches compared with sham‐gammaCore used with SoC in ACT1 and ACT2 trials. However, the economic impact has not been characterized for this indication. We conducted a cost‐effectiveness analysis of gammaCore adjunct to SoC compared with SoC alone for the treatment of acute pain associated with episodic cluster headache attacks. The model structure was based on treatment of acute attacks with 3 outcomes: failures, nonresponders, and responders. The time horizon of the model is 1 year using a payer perspective with uncertainty incorporated. Parameter inputs were derived from primary data from the randomized controlled trials for gammaCore. The mean annual costs associated with the gammaCore‐plus‐SoC arm was $9510, and mean costs for the SoC‐alone arm was $10,040. The mean quality‐adjusted life years for gammaCore‐plus‐SoC arm were 0.83, and for the SoC‐alone arm, they were 0.74. The gammaCore‐plus‐SoC arm was dominant over SoC alone. All 1‐way and multiway sensitivity analyses were cost‐effective using a threshold of $20,000. gammaCore dominance, representing savings, was driven by superior efficacy, improvement in quality of life (QoL), and reduction in costs associated with successful and consistent abortion of episodic attacks. These findings serve as additional economic evidence to support coverage for gammaCore. Additional real‐world data are needed to characterize the long‐term impact of gammaCore on comorbidities, utilization, QoL, daily functioning, productivity, and social engagement of these patients, and for other indications.

AB: We analyzed a prospective registry cohort of 1085 German routine patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma receiving systemic therapy to demonstrate that, over the past decade, newly approved treatments have quickly been applied to routine care. High‐risk or trial‐ineligible patients still have poor outcomes. Survival times in trial‐eligible patients are similar to those reported from randomized clinical trials. Introduction: Because the treatment landscape for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has evolved dramatically over the past decade, data on patients' treatment and outcomes in routine practice, so called "real‐world data," are important to complement clinical trial data. We present choice of systemic first‐/second‐line treatments, number and sequences of treatment lines, and survival of patients with clear cell mRCC. Patients and Methods: A total of 1085 patients with clear cell mRCC who were recruited at the start of first‐line treatment into the prospective German clinical cohort study (RCC‐Registry) by 122 sites between December 2007 and May 2017 were analyzed. Results: The choice of first‐/second‐line treatment and changes over time reflect the chronologic approval of different targeted agents: from mainly tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), to TKIs/mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors, to now TKIs/mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors/checkpoint inhibitor. The median first‐line overall survival ranged from 7.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8‐10.9 months) in high MSKCC (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) risk to 36.7 months (95% CI, 27.9‐43.0 months) in low‐risk patients. For trial‐ineligible routine patients meeting common exclusion criteria of clinical trials, the median overall survival was 14.6 months (95% CI, 11.5‐18.0 months) compared with 26.2 months (95% CI, 22.1‐31.5 months) for potentially trial‐eligible patients. Conclusion: This is the first prospective long‐term cohort study showing changes in treatment reality and survival of routine patients with clear cell mRCC. Newly approved treatments are quickly applied in routine care. Patients with unfavorable prognosis, including trial‐ineligible patients, have inferior outcomes. Survival times of potentially trial‐eligible patients are similar to those reported from clinical trials. Copyright © 2018 The Authors

AB: Introduction: Renal functional impairment is linked to an increased risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) treated with warfarin and rivaroxaban. Anticoagulants such as warfarin and rivaroxaban are often recommended to reduce the risk of stroke in NVAF patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare thromboembolic and bleeding event rates for warfarin and rivaroxaban patients stratified by presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: Claims from the IMS Health Real‐World Data Adjudicated Claims database from 05/2011‐6/2015 were analyzed. Adult patients with NVAF who had >=6 months of baseline data prior to the first dispensing of warfarin or rivaroxaban after 11/2011 were included. Patients were followed until the end of index therapy or end of data availability/insurance coverage. Outcomes were stratified by presence of CKD for ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and a composite measure of thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) or venous thromboembolism (VTE)) and analyzed using hazard ratios (HRs). Adjustments for confounding were made with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW). Results: The analysis included 39,872 rivaroxaban (9.0% [3,572 of 39,872] with CKD) and 48,637 warfarin patients (16.9% [8,230 of 48,637] with CKD). As expected, thromboembolic and bleeding events were more common in patients with CKD than those without CKD. Rivaroxaban patients had significantly lower risk of ischemic stroke, both in the overall population (HR = 0.79 [0.68‐0.90], p=0.0008) and for those with CKD (HR = 0.55 [0.40‐0.77], p=0.0004). A composite of thromboembolic events were lower with rivaroxaban irrespective of CKD. Major bleeding rates were comparable across all groups. Table 1 reports incidence rates and HRs stratified by presence of CKD. Conclusions: This study suggests that, in an adult population with NVAF, rivaroxaban‐treated patients had fewer ischemic strokes across all patients, including patients with renal impairment. Rivaroxaban‐treated patients also had significantly better outcomes for the composite (VTE, MI, or stroke) measure across all groups. Bleeding rates were comparable across all groups.

AB: Background: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) alirocumab (Sanofi and Regeneron) and evolocumab (Amgen) were approved by the FDA in the summer of 2015 for use in patients on maximally tolerated statins with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who require additional lowering of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C). Both clinical trial programs were skewed towards male participants so little is known about the characteristics of female patients treated with PCSK9i in real‐world settings. Objective: To understand the demographic and clinical differences between male and female patients prescribed a PCSK9i in real‐world settings. Methods: All patients 18 years of age and older with evidence of a PCSK9i prescription (Rx) between July 27, 2015 and November 1, 2016 were included from Accenture's "Predictive Health Intelligence Environment", a database consisting of electronic medical records (EMR) from 26 integrated delivery networks in the US. Patients were also required to have at least one encounter in the EMR in the 24‐month period prior to the first PCSK9i Rx. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients were evaluated as well as the Rx history prior to the first PCSK9i Rx. Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 1,754 patients with 906 (51.7%) being female. Mean (SD) age was 65.9 (10.4) for females compared to 64.3 (10.3) for males; however, a higher proportion of females (59.6%) were over age 65 as compared to males (51.5%, difference not significant). Females were statistically less likely to have a prior event for ASCVD (54% vs. 73%, p<0.0001). Additionally, females were significantly more likely to have a BMI < 25 kg/m compared to males (19.1% v. 11.0%, p<0.001). No differences were observed in prescribing specialty, prior lipid modifying treatment or history of smoking. Finally, females had a significantly higher mean baseline LDL‐C as compared to males (149.4 mg/dL [58.2] v. 123.9 mg/dL [56.6], p<0.001). Conclusions: Despite the clinical trial programs of both PCSK9i's being skewed toward male participants, this real‐world data consisted of nearly equal numbers of males and females. In this study, females were more likely to be identified as FH, as indicated by their significantly higher levels of LDL‐C, despite similarities in prior treatment regimens as compared to males. Further research is warranted to understand diagnosis and treatment patterns in women as compared to men as well as how their cardiovascular health can be improved.

AB: Introduction: Real‐world data on diabetes mellitus (DM) in Brazil is scarce. Given the complexity of current DM management, an understanding of the disease profile is essential to inform clinical and public health decisions. Objective: We aimed to describe the proportion of T1DM and T2DM patients with HbA1c < 7.0%, the socio demographic and clinical characteristics of DM patients and the therapeutic strategies adopted in Brazil. Methods: This was an observational, cross‐sectional study, conducted between January and June 2016 in 250 public and private healthcare centers, randomly selected across Brazil. Results: Overall, 2590 patients (51.8% male) were included, of which 244 (9.4%) had T1DM and 2 346 (90.6%) had T2DM. Most T1DM patients (43.4%) were in the 18‐30 age group and most T2DM patients (51.5%) were in the 5170 age group. BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was found for 14.6% of T1DM patients and 36.6% of T2DM patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 25.1 (SD 15.8) years for T1DM and 50.8 (SD 12.6) years for T2DM. Most patients (76.9%) are followed in the private healthcare sector. The most frequent comorbidity was dyslipidemia (46.7%; n = 1209), both for T1DM patients (20.1%; n = 49) and T2DM patients (49.4%; n = 1160). HbA1C < 7.0% was found for 41.8% (95% CI [34.7%; 49.0%]) of T1DM patients and for 52.3% (95% CI [50.1%; 54.5%]) of T2DM patients. Among T2DM patients, 14.4% (n = 338) were insulin‐treated, of which 55.6% (n = 188) with NPH, 23.7% (n = 80) with fast‐acting insulin analogues, 22.8% (n = 77) with long‐acting insulin analogues, 13.6% (n = 46) with regular insulin and 3.6% (n = 12) with premixed insulin. The oral antidiabetics most commonly used by T2DM patients were metformin (n = 1538; 65.6%), followed by DDP‐4 inhibitors (n = 774; 33.0%) and sulfonylureas (n = 644; 27.5%). On average, patients attend 3.7 appointments per year for diabetes management (T1DM: 4.3; T2DM: 3.6). Conclusion: A high proportion of patients in this cohort did not meet the glycemic control target of HbA1C < 7.0%, even though most were under pharmacological treatment. Given the risk of diabetic complications posed by uncontrolled disease, further action should be taken to address this issue. Globally, this study offers valuable insight into DM's epidemiology and management in Brazil. Funding: This study was funded by Sanofi.

AB: Background and Aims: SVR12 with 12‐week SMV+SOF+/‐RBV therapy was shown to be high for HCV GT1 patients in COSMOS study, but its generalizability is limited due to small sample size in a highly controlled clinical trial. Less is known about the effectiveness of the regimen in a real‐life setting. Our goal was to perform a meta‐analysis of real‐world data evaluating the effectiveness of SMV+SOF+/‐RBV. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for 'simeprevir' in MEDLINE and major liver meetings in 2014 (AASLD, APASL, DDW, EASL, and World Transplant Congress) was performed and data was extracted in November 2014 by two authors using a case report form (BY and NN) with discrepancies resolved by consensus with a third author (MN). We included studies with SVR12 data that had >5 HCV GT1 patients treated with SMV+SOF+/‐RBV for 12 weeks. Those who had prior liver transplantation or were coinfected with HIV or HBV were excluded. Primary endpoint was pooled effect sizes for SVR12 with random effects modeling. To evaluate study heterogeneity, Cochrane Q‐test (p‐value <0.10) with I2 statistic (>50%) was determined. Results: Seven studies with a total of 715 HCV GT1 patients were included. All were non‐randomized cohorts. The majority of patients were male (range 57‐81%). Many had advanced fibrosis (range 45‐64%). Overall rate of SVR4 was 91.6% (CI: 87.5‐94.5%) and SVR12 was 83.4% (CI: 79.6‐86.7%). Three studies had SVR12 data sub‐grouped by severity of fibrosis (n = 296, 147 with mild fibrosis and 149 with advanced fibrosis). Definition of advanced fibrosis was variable and included METAVIR F3‐F4 or cirrhotic patients. SVR12 rate was 89.7% (CI 79.0‐95.3%) in patients with mild fibrosis and 76.2% (CI 68.6‐82.4%) in advanced fibrosis. By direct comparison, a trend was found favoring SVR12 for patients with mild fibrosis over advanced fibrosis (OR 2.66, CI 0.816‐8.650; p‐value = 0.105). Data was insufficient to allow evaluation of adverse events or subanalysis for outcomes of SMV+SOF with and without RBV or treatment naive and experienced patients. Conclusions: Pooled rate of SVR12 was approximately 83% in SIM+SOF+/‐RBV for 12 weeks based on cohort studies from realworld settings which include a large proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis and/or prior treatment failure and slightly lower than reported rated from clinical trial, suggesting the importance of examining treatment effectiveness in diverse real‐world patients in addition to treatment efficacy seen in highly selected clinical trial patients.

DOI: 10.1007/s00125-016-4046-9
AB: Background and aims: Dyslipidemia is a common cardiovascular risk factor in adults with type‐2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend narrow target values for lipids in this high‐risk‐group, real‐life data indicate that these targets are frequently missed. Materials and methods: DIVE and DPV, two large multicenter registries on real‐life care for adult patients with diabetes (type 1, type 2 and others) continuously and longitudinally record data on clinical care and outcome in Germany. The DIVE‐registry currently includes 89,871 patients with type‐2‐diabetes at 159 centers, while DPVincludes 303,996 patients with type‐2 diabetes at 442 centers. This analysis is based on 68,482 adult patients with type‐2 diabetes treated in 2014 or 2015 and having a complete lipid status (Total Cholesterol [TC], HDL‐C, LDL‐C, Triglycerides) available. Non‐HDL‐C was calculated as TC minus HDL‐C. Target values from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC/EAS) guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias were applied. Results: 94% of patients with type‐2 diabetes failed to achieve the ESC/EAS target for lipid values, with 84% of patients failing on two target values. LDL‐cholesterol below 70 mg/dl, as recommended was achieved by 13% of patients only, followed by only 18% of subjects achieving a non‐HDL‐cholesterol < 100 mg/dl. Prevalence of dyslipidemia was higher in females compared to males, and in younger patients (80 years of age. Patients on statins displayed lower TC, LDL‐C and non‐HDL‐C values and thus a lower rate of dyslipidemia. Remarkably, only 32% of patients were treated with statins. Treatment rate was higher in males (34%) compared to females (30%) and highest in the age‐group 60‐80 years (35%) as compared to younger (26%) and older (31%) patients. Conclusion: These real‐world data indicate a high rate of dyslipidemia, if current guideline recommendations are used to define target lipid values. These guidelines recommend a much higher rate of statin therapy in patients with type‐2 diabetes as was observed. Patients treated with statins display better lipid profiles, however the majority still does not reach recommended target values.

AB: Background: Few studies have estimated the economic effect of using an opioid that is associated with lower rates of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) than another opioid for postsurgical pain. Objective: To estimate the number of postsurgical GI events and incremental hospital costs, including potential savings, associated with lower GI AE rates, for tapentadol immediate release (IR) versus oxycodone IR, using a literature‐based calculator. Methods: An electronic spreadsheet‐based cost calculator was developed to estimate the total number of GIAEs (ie, nausea, vomiting, or constipation) and incremental costs to a hospital when using tapentadol IR 100 mg versus oxycodone IR 15 mg, in a hypothetical cohort of 1500 hospitalized patients requiring short‐acting opioids for postsurgical pain. Data inputs were chosen from recently published, well‐designed studies, including GI AE rates from a previously published phase 3 clinical trial of postsurgical patients who received these 2 opioids; GI event‐related incremental length of stay from a large US hospital database; drug costs using wholesale acquisition costs in 2011 US dollars; and average hospitalization cost from the 2009 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database. The base case assumed that 5% (chosen as a conservative estimate) of patients admitted to the hospital would shift from oxycodone IR to tapentadol IR. Results: In this hypothetical cohort of 1500 hospitalized patients, replacing 5% of oxycodone IR 15‐mg use with tapentadol IR 100‐mg use predicted reductions in the total number of GI events from 1095 to 1085, and in the total cost of GI AEs from $2,978,400 to $2,949,840. This cost reduction translates to a net savings of $22,922 after factoring in drug cost. For individual GI events, the net savings were $26,491 for nausea; $12,212 for vomiting; and $7187 for constipation. Conclusion: Using tapentadol IR in place of a traditional μ‐opioid shows the potential for reduced GI events and subsequent cost‐savings in the postsurgical hospital setting. In the absence of sufficient real‐world data, this literature‐based cost calculator may assist hospital Pharmacy & Therapeutics committees in their evaluation of the costs of opioid‐related GI events.

AB: Background: There are special concerns, including safety, that need to be addressed when devising treatment strategies for ulcerative colitis (UC) in elderly patients. Given the increasing number of elderly patients with UC in Japan, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of several treatments and the issues including complications in elderly patients with UC as real‐world data. Methods: In this single‐centre retrospective case‐control study, we investigated 220 hospitalised patients with UC from January 2013 to December 2015 at our hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: an elderly group aged >=60 years (n = 42) and a nonelderly group aged <60 years (n = 178). The clinical background, treatment efficacy, treatment safety, and issues were compared between the two groups. Results: The proportions of left‐sided colitis and complicated cytomegalovirus infection at admission were significantly higher in the elderly group (35.7%, 65.7%) than in the non‐elderly group (19.7%, 25.8%) (P = 0.03, p < 0.001). The maximal dose of steroid per day within a month before admission was significantly lower in the elderly group (14.5 +/‐ 18.0 mg) than in the non‐elderly group (50.8 +/‐ 146.8 mg) (p = 0.006). There was a significant difference in the contents of first‐line remission induction therapy between the two groups (p = 0.02) (steroid 35.7%, tacrolimus 23.8%, cytapheresis 11.9%, infliximab 11.9%, adalimumab 2.4% in the elderly group; 38.8%, 37.1%, 2.8%, 14.6%, and 0% in the non‐elderly group, respectively). There was no difference in remission induction or the response rate to these treatments, as well as in the surgical rate between the two groups (p = 0.13). However, the response rate to steroid treatment tended to be lower in the elderly (40.5%) than in the non‐elderly (64.0%) (p = 0.03). The complications of cytomegalovirus infection and catheter infection were significantly higher in the elderly group (66.7%, 11.9%) than in the non‐elderly group (25.8%, 2.8%) (p < 0.001, p = 0.03). No case achieved remission through second‐line therapy after the failure of first‐line treatment in the elderly group. Conclusions: The efficacy of first‐line therapy in the elderly group was not inferior to that in the non‐elderly group, although the elderly group had more infection‐related complications. However, the efficacy of steroid as a first‐line therapy or overall second‐line therapy was inferior in the elderly group. In case of failure of the first‐line therapy, surgery should be considered as a life‐saving measure.

PT: Conference Abstract
AB: Rationale: COPD is a progressive, potentially life‐threatening disease. It often co‐exists with other chronic diseases that can contribute to patients' prognosis and altogether lead to increased risk of fatal events. Extrafine inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)‐containing regimen decreases the risk of COPD exacerbations. Assessing their safety is also crucial to confirm their favourable benefit‐risk ratio. In recent years, the efficacy of ICS‐containing medications in reducing mortality in COPD patients has been debated based on randomised trials and real‐world data, leaving the question still unanswered. Methods: Three 52‐week multi‐centre, randomised, double‐blind, activecontrolled studies recruited symptomatic COPD patients, with severe airflow limitation and an exacerbation history. In TRILOGY, patients were randomised (1:1) to a fixed triple combination of extrafine beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium (BDP/FF/G 100/6/12.5mcg, two actuations twice daily [BID] via pressurised metered dose inhaler [pMDI]; Trimbow) or a fixed combination of extrafine BDP/FF (100/6mcg, two actuations BID via pMDI Foster) (Singh et al. Lancet 2016 388: 963‐73). In TRINITY patients were randomised (2:2:1) to extrafine BDP/FF/G, tiotropium (TIO) (18mcg once daily (OD) via singledose dry powder inhaler [SDDPI]), or extrafine BDP/FF + TIO (Vestbo et al. Lancet 2017 389: 1919‐29). In TRIBUTE patients were randomised (1:1) to extrafine BDP/FF/G or Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium bromide (IND/GLY 85/43mcg, OD via SDDPI; Ultibro)) (Papi et al. Lancet 2018; in press). We evaluated mortality by considering all events leading to a fatal outcome during the study treatment periods. We then compared all extrafine ICS‐containing combinations (BDP/FF/G, BDP/FF, BDP/FF+TIO) versus ICS‐free treatments (TIO, IND/GLY), as well as comparing only the recently marketed extrafine BDP/FF/G (Trimbow) versus ICS‐free treatments. Results: When comparing time to death from pooled data for all extrafine ICScontaining treatments versus ICS‐free treatments the Hazard Ratio (HR) showed a numerical reduction in the risk of developing a fatal event (p=0.066) (Table 1). A similar effect was seen when comparing only BDP/FF/G vs ICS‐free treatments (Table 1). Conclusions: These results show that the extrafine ICS‐containing medications compared to ICS‐free treatments may be associated with a lower rate of mortality in symptomatic COPD patients at risk for exacerbations. Notably, these results are confirmed when referring specifically to the extrafine triple combination BDP/FF/G.

AB: Background and Aims: SVR12 with 12‐week SMV+SOF+/‐RBV therapy was shown to be high for HCV GT1 patients in COSMOS study, but its generalizability is limited due to small sample size in a highly controlled clinical trial. Less is known about the effectiveness of the regimen in a real‐life setting. Our goal was to perform a meta‐analysis of real‐world data evaluating the effectiveness of SMV+SOF+/‐RBV. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for 'simeprevir' in MEDLINE and major liver meetings (AASLD, APASL, DDW, EASL, and World Transplant Congress 2014) was performed and data extracted in November 2014 by two authors using a case report form (BY and NN) with discrepancies resolved by consensus with a third author (MN). We included studies with SVR12 data that had >5 HCV GT1 patients treated with SMV+SOF+/‐RBV for 12 weeks. Those who had prior liver transplantation or were co‐infected with HIV or HBV were excluded. To estimate pooled effect sizes, random effects modeling was used. To evaluate study heterogeneity, Cochrane Q‐test (p‐value <0.10) with I2 statistic (>50%) was determined. Results: Seven studies with a total of 715 HCV GT1 patients were included. All were non‐randomized cohorts. The majority of patients were male (range 57‐81%). Many had advanced fibrosis (range 45‐ 64%). Overall rates of SVR4 was 91.6% (CI: 87.5‐94.5%) and SVR12 was 83.4% (CI: 79.6‐ 86.7%). Three studies had SVR12 data sub‐grouped by severity of fibrosis (n=296, 147 with mild fibrosis and 149 with advanced fibrosis). Definition of advanced fibrosis was variable and included METAVIR F3‐F4 or cirrhotic patients. SVR12 rate was 89.7% (CI 79.0‐95.3%) in patients with mild fibrosis and 76.2% (CI 68.6‐82.4%) in advanced fibrosis. By direct comparison, a trend was found favoring SVR12 for patients with mild fibrosis over advanced fibrosis (OR 2.66, CI 0.816‐8.650; p‐value=0.105). Data was insufficient to allow evaluation of serious adverse events or subanalysis for outcomes of SMV+SOF with and without RBV or treatment naive and experienced patients. Conclusions: Pooled rate of SVR12 was approximately 83% in SIM+SOF+/‐RBV based on cohort studies from real‐world settings which include a large proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis and/or prior treatment failure and slightly lower than reported rated from clinical trial, suggesting the importance of examining treatment effectiveness in diverse real‐world patients in addition to treatment efficacy seen in highly selected clinical trial patients.

AB: Background: PsoBest is a large registry of adult patients with plaque‐type psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis in Germany. Fumaric acid esters (FAE) represent the most widely‐used oral systemic treatment for moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis in Germany. Objectives: To describe long‐term drug survival, treatment discontinuations, compliance and Patient Benefit Index (PBI) scores in patients treated with FAE in PsoBest. Methods: Between 2007‐2015, patients who started new systemic therapy with FAE were assessed for drug survival, treatment discontinuations, compliance (physician‐and patient‐assessed) and PBI. Patients with combined anti‐psoriatic systemic treatment at baseline and without baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) data were excluded. Results: During the assessment period, 1409 patients started treatment with FAE. Median duration of illness was 14.9 years, and 85.6% of patients had received no prior systemic therapy. Median drug survival of FAE (regardless of dose changes during treatment) was 58.0 months (mean 47.9 months); drug survival rates were 79.1, 70.1, 66.7 and 61.8% at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, respectively. There were 362 (25.7%) treatment discontinuations; reasons for these included side effects (n = 26; 7.2%), skin clearance (n = 4; 1.1%) and 'other reasons' (n = 33; 9.1%). No discontinuations occurred due to contraindications. The most frequently reported adverse event was diarrhoea (15.6%). Physician‐assessed compliance was reported to be 'very good' for most patients (66.7%) after 3 months on FAE, and most patients (69.5%) confirmed regular intake after 3 months of treatment. Mean PBI scores were 2.5, 2.8 and 3.0 at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. In terms of the treatment goal of 'having fewer side effects', most patients (57.0%) rated their FAE treatment as 'at least minimal benefit' (PBI ≥ 1) after 3 months, rising to 64.5% after 12 months. In terms of 'having confidence in the therapy', most patients (85.7%) confirmed confidence in their FAE treatment (PBI ≥ 1) after 3 months.Long‐term drug survival in this analysis was similar to a previous report of patients treated with FAE from PsoBest (median 54.8 months).1, Treatment discontinuations were lower in our real‐world data set (25.7%), compared with FAE‐treated patients in randomised controlled trials (~40%). A previous analysis of PsoBest revealed that non‐response could be due to a range of factors, and that discontinuation due to side effects or lack of efficacy were the primary reasons in only a small proportion of patients (6.3% and 1.6% at 6 months, respectively).2, The high levels of compliance and patient‐relevant benefit (PBI) may contribute to the long‐term survival of FAE in PsoBest.

AB: BACKGROUND: Although ~50% of treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the U.S. do not meet glycemic targets, treatment adjustment may be delayed or not initiated ('clinical inertia'), which is often associated with poor outcomes. OBJECTIVE(S): To compare clinical outcomes in patients with T2D inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) who underwent treatment intensification (TI) vs. no treatment intensification (NTI). METHOD(S): Data were collected from the Optum administrative claims database from January 1, 2009, to August 31, 2015. Patients were divided into cohorts based on evidence of TI (addition of a sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] or dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 [DPP‐4] inhibitor, a third OAD, insulin or a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist [GLP‐1 RA]) within 6 months of the first glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C) >= 7.0% (index date). A1C change from the index date and hypoglycemia events (diagnosis code for hypoglycemia or diabetes with other specified manifestation) were determined 12 months after TI or a randomly selected date for the NTI cohort. Bivariate comparisons were made between the two cohorts; ordinary least squares models and logistic regression were used to adjust for confounders in A1C change and hypoglycemia, respectively. RESULT(S): Of a total of 28,123 adults receiving dual OAD therapy and with evidence of A1C >= 7.0%, 3,990 (14.2%) underwent TI. Patients in the TI cohort were younger than patients in the NTI cohort (58.3 vs. 61.3 years; P < 0.001); the proportion of men was higher in the TI cohort (59.0% vs. 57.2%; P = 0.033). Index A1C was higher in the TI cohort (8.8% vs. 8.0%; P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, TI patients showed greater A1C reductions than NTI patients (‐0.59% vs. ‐0.25%; P < 0.001). The hypoglycemia rate was higher in the TI cohort (odds ratio: 1.68; P < 0.001). Only 31.2% of TI patients met glycemic targets at follow‐up. CONCLUSION(S): These real‐world data show that clinical inertia is still widespread despite the availability of multiple treatment options for T2D. TI was effective in achieving glycemic control but was associated with a higher hypoglycemia rate. In addition, less than one‐third of patients reached recommended A1C targets at 12 months. Our data indicate a need for new agents that effectively manage glycemia and lower hypoglycemia risk.

AB: Background: The efficacy of endovascular therapy (EVT) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for acute strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) led to AHA guidelines recommending EVT as standard of care for selected patients. However, many conditions were under‐represented in the RCTs: ASPECTS <6, age ≥80 yo, NIHSS <6, onset to treatment >6 hrs and M2/ distal/ posterior circulation occlusions. Objective: We evaluated EVT outcomes in these populations compared to counterparts represented in the RCTs. Methods: A large multicenter international prospective cohort study of LVO patients treated with stent retriever thrombectomy (TREVO Registry) between 11/2013 and 4/2016 was analyzed. 90 day mRS was the primary outcome (0‐2 good outcome). Multivariate logistic regression modeling was employed to evaluate EVT impact in the different groups. Results: Of 1000 patients, 81 had NIHSS <6 and 81.5% of those achieved a good outcome (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9‐6.8; p<0.001 compared with NIHSS ≥6) (Table 1). Over 80 yo, however, had low odds of independence (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2‐0.5; p<0.001 compared with <80 yo). Among 212 patients treated >6 hrs, 51% had a good outcome (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55‐1.1; p=0.17) compared to ≤6 hrs. Nearly half of patients with ASPECTS <6 (3‐5) had a good outcome. Fig 1 illustrates mRS distributions stratified by the different subgroups. There were low rates of sICH for treated patients with NIHSS<6, age≥80, ASPECTS <6 or treatment >6 hrs. Fig 2 demonstrates the likelihood of good outcome by clot location. M2 and distal occlusions had the highest good outcome probabilities while proximal ICAs had the lowest (48.1%). More than half of vertebrobasilar patients achieved independence (54.8%). Conclusion: While effectiveness cannot be determined in the absence of medically treated controls, our analyses of real world data show several groups outside AHA guidelines may benefit from EVT. In particular, further study is needed to examine EVT benefits for mild stroke and M2 occlusions.

AB: Objective: The Trevo Registry is designed to assess real world outcomes of the Trevo Retriever in patients experiencing ischemic stroke. This is the largest prospective study for acute stroke intervention, with 1247 patients currently enrolled and 90 day outcomes in 1021 patients. The primary endpoint is revascularization status based on post‐procedure TICI score and secondary endpoints include 90‐day mRS, 90‐day mortality, neurological deterioration at 24 hours and device/procedure related adverse events. Methods: The study is a prospective, open‐label, consecutive enrollment, multi‐center, international registry of patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke using the Trevo stent retriever as the initial device. Enrollment is expected to reach 2000 subjects at up to 100 sites. Results: As of August 13, 2016 a total of 1247 patients were enrolled. The median NIHSS at admission was 16 (IQR 11‐20). Most patients (66.2%) were treated at >/= 6 hours from last known normal with a median procedure time of 50 minutes (32‐77). The occlusion site was M1 or M2 in 74.5%. General anesthesia was employed in 46.6% of procedures. TICI 2b or 3 revascularization was 92.8% with an average of 1.6 passes with the device. Median NIHSS at 24 hours and discharge was 6 and 4 respectively. Fifty‐five percent of patients had mRS <=2 at 3 months and the overall mortality rate was 15.4%. Patients treated after 8 hours of symptom onset had a 94.9% revascularization rate and 52.8% mRS <=2 at 3 months. The symptomatic ICH rate was 1.2%. Patients who met the revised AHA criteria for thrombectomy were found to have 58.4% mRS 0‐2 at 90 days. Conclusions: The Trevo Retriever Registry represents the first real world data with stent retriever use in the era of clinical trials showing the overwhelming benefit of stent retrievers to treat acute ischemic stroke. Due to the fact that this data represents real world use of the Trevo Retriever, (e.g. subjects prestroke mRS >1 (16.5%) and those treated 6‐24 hours after stroke symptoms (33.8%), this data cannot be compared to the results from recent trials with restricted eligibility criteria. Future subgroup analysis of this large cohort will help to identify areas of future research to enhance outcomes further with this treatment modality.

PT: Conference Abstract
AB: Background: Afatinib, an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker, is approved in many countries for treatment of advanced EGFR mutation‐positive NSCLC, as well as squamous cell carcinoma of the lung following platinumbased chemotherapy. An afatinib NPU program was initiated in 2010, after the Phase IIb/III LUX‐Lung 1 trial demonstrated significantly improved progression‐free survival and objective response rate (ORR) with afatinib versus placebo, in advanced NSCLC patients following failure of erlotinib and/or gefitinib and 1‐2 lines of chemotherapy. This analysis of the NPU program provides real‐world data for afatinib use in global clinical practice for NSCLC patients with no established therapeutic option. Methods: Patients eligible for the NPU program had: advanced NSCLC; progressed after clinical benefit on prior erlotinib or gefitinib, and/or had an activating EGFR/HER2 mutation; exhausted all other treatment options (chemotherapy‐naive patients were eligible if deemed unfit for chemotherapy); and were ineligible for actively recruiting afatinib trials. Physicians provided a pseudonymised data set for each patient participating in the program. Time to treatment failure (TTF, in months) was defined as the time from the start of afatinib to treatment discontinuation for any reason (including disease progression, intolerability and death). Results: As of January 2016, data were available from 3966 NSCLC patients, from 41 countries across 6 continents. Patients were heavily pretreated, with ~50% receiving afatinib as >=4th‐line treatment; almost all patients (3678/3699; 97.9%) received prior erlotinib and/or gefitinib. Among 2595/3966 (65.4%) patients with known tumour EGFR status, 2407 (92.8%) were EGFR mutation‐positive. Median TTF for afatinib, calculated for 2862/3966 (72.2%) patients based on available data, was 4.4 months, and 4.3 months in each patient subgroup, consisting of any EGFR mutation, common EGFR mutations (Del19 or L858R), or uncommon EGFR mutations (e.g. T790M, exon 20, L861Q). Response assessments were reported in 1141/2862 (39.9%) patients; the ORR was 23% (267/1141) for all patients and 25% (181/723) for those with NSCLC harbouring any EGFR mutation. Notably, a 26% (26/100) ORR was reported in patients with NSCLC harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations, including 19% (11/58) in T790M mutation‐positive patients and 35% (7/20) in those with insertions in exon 20. No new or unexpected safety findings were observed. Conclusions: This afatinib NPU program in nearly 4000 NSCLC patients who were refractory to several therapies, including prior erlotinib and gefitinib, revealed encouraging effectiveness measures, such as TTF durations and tumour response rates for all patients, including those with NSCLC harbouring common or uncommon EGFR mutations. Safety data were consistent with the known profile of afatinib.

DOI: 10.1002/art.39977
AB: Background/Purpose: Abatacept is a new class of biologic agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that inhibits T cell activation by binding to CD80/86. Although some clinicians feel that the rapidity of treatment response of abatacept is slower than that of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐inhibitors, some patients can respond to abatacept treatment quite rapidly. Recently, some reports have been published regarding the positive association between sero‐positivity for anti‐citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) and clinical efficacy of abatacept in RA patients. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of double‐seropositivity for ACPA and rheumatoid factor (RF) on the rapidity of treatment response of abatacept using data from a Japanese multicenter registry system for RA patients treated with biologic agents. Methods: Participants were selected from the consecutive 508 RA patients treated with abatacept who were registered in the Tsurumai Biologics Communication Registry (TBCR). We excluded the patients with previous biologic agent treatment history since it has been already reported as an independent factor affecting the clinical efficacy of abatacept. A total of 146 biologics‐naive and ACPA positive patients with baseline data of RF were included in this study. We compared the proportion of patients that achieved good EULAR response at 24 weeks between the RF negative and RF positive (>20 U/ml) group within the ACPA positive patients. We defined the ACPA positive as >13.5 U/ml of anti‐CCP antibody (3 times cutoff value) to ensure that the positivity was reasonably sure. Results: In the ACPA positive patients, the percent decreasing of DAS28‐CRP scores in the RF positive group were significantly greater than those in the RF negative group at all time points (Figure A, e.g. ‐32.3 vs ‐12.6% at 24 weeks, p < 0.01). The proportion of patients that achieved the good EULAR response was significantly higher in the RA positive group at 12 and 24 weeks (Figure B). Multivariate logistic regression analysis (adjusted with gender, age, Steinbrockerfs stage, concomitant MTX and oral steroid usage, and DAS28‐CRP score at baseline) revealed that the RF positivity, along with the modified HAQ score at baseline, was the independent predictor for the achievement of good EULAR response at 24 weeks (Figure C). Conclusion: We clearly demonstrated that the positive association of the double‐seropositivity for ACPA and RF with the rapid and good clinical response for abatacept in the biologics‐naive RA patients. This new clinical evidence regarding the effect of doubleseropositivity is the valuable real‐world data for the prediction of clinical efficacy of abatacept in daily clinical practice.

AB: Background/Rationale: In a Phase III randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of CMV‐seropositive post‐HSCT recipients, letermovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection through week 24. Objectives: To assess the impact of CMV prophylaxis on rates of rehospitalization in adult CMV seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients from the letermovir phase 3 clinical trial. Methods: Rehospitalization was recorded as an exploratory endpoint in the clinical trial at end of treatment (Week 14), time of primary endpoint (Week 24) and through an extended follow‐up period (Week 48). CMV‐related rehospitalization was assessed in the trial. Prespecified analyses describe the observed rates of rehospitalization for the letermovir and placebo groups at the specified times. Fine‐Gray cumulative incidence function (CIF) regression models were used to explore the rate of all‐cause, and CMV‐related rehospitalization accounting for the competing risk of mortality. A multiple linear regression model was used to describe the cumulative length of stay (LOS) for all‐cause rehospitalizations that occurred through Week 48 (excluding time of initial transplant stay). Results: Observed rates of all‐cause rehospitalization were lower for the letermovir group compared to placebo at end of treatment (36.6% vs. 47.6%), time of primary endpoint (48.6% vs. 55.3%), and through extended follow‐up (55.7% vs. 60.6%). The CIF regression model demonstrated rates of all‐cause rehospitalization were significantly lower through Week 14 (HR=0.72; p=0.021) but did not reach significance at Week 24 (HR=0.81; p=0.109) or Week 48 (HR=0.84; p=0.173); and CMV‐related rehospitalizations were significantly reduced at Week 14 (0.6% vs. 7.1%; HR=0.09; p=0.001), Week 24 (2.8% vs. 7.6%; HR=0.36; p=0.015), and Week 48 (3.1% vs. 8.8%; HR=0.34; p=0.007). The adjusted mean cumulative LOS was shorter for letermovir than placebo but did not reach statistical significance (3.1 fewer days p=0.333). Conclusions: Letermovir was shown to significantly reduce the rate of clinically significant CMV infection in a placebo‐controlled randomized clinical trial. These analyses suggest that there is also a reduction in the rate and cumulative days of rehospitalization. This trial was not sufficiently powered to detect differences in this exploratory endpoint. Nonetheless, these data provide valuable insights into the economic burden of CMV. Real world data and findings from future clinical trials are needed to better understand the nature of the association between CMV and rehospitalizations.

AB: Background and Objective: During the last years, developments in the battle against multiple sclerosis (MS) include oral drugs, a steep forward, knowing that until recently only parenteral treatments where available. Starting last year, in our hospital have become available Aubagio (teriflunomide) as a unique option of oral treatment for patients with relapsing forms of MS. Administrated 14 mg once‐daily, reduces the number of overactive immune cells thought to cause MS flare‐ups, while still allowing normal immune cell activity to occur. Teriflunomide has been approved by Food and Drugs Administration since 2012 and by European Medicines Agency since 2013. The aim of this study was to analyse the reason of treatment change from parenteral drugs to oral drug teriflunomide. Setting and Method: Observational retrospective study. Data was collected from patients with MS who receiving chronic treatment for years and changed during 2016‐2017. We reviewed the medical history to confirm previous treatment and the reasons of treatment change. A statistical descriptive analysis of collected data was performed. Main outcome measures: Previous treatment, reason of the treatment change, adverse reaction with the previous treatment, any relationship between preferences for oral drugs versus age of the patient. Results: 23 patients with mean disease duration 4,6 years, median EDSS 2,6 (1‐5.5), received teriflunomide during 2016‐2017, mostly women 19 (82%), the median age was 36 +/‐ 11 years. 9 patients received teriflunomide as initiation treatment, because the preference for oral drugs (fear of injections) and from the rest of 14 patients previous failed therapies was: Betaferon‐7, Copaxone‐3, Avonex‐2, Rebif‐1, Tysabri‐1. Medication with a higher discontinuation rate was Betaferon and Copaxone. Regarding the reasons of treatment change the most frequent causes was: lack of efficacy‐8, local side effects‐4, systemic side‐effect‐1. One patient showed risk of progressive multifocal leukoen‐cephalopathy from Tysabri. Side‐effects caused by Betaferon and Copaxone was skin reaction at the injection site, no depression was detected. No relationship between age and the choice of oral therapy was observed. Conclusion: Oral drugs providing not only new treatment options and new challenges but also allow patients a better quality of life. Because there are not innocuous, the role of clinical pharmacist is crucial in monitoring side‐effects, especially regarding counseling and education young patients on birth defects even 2 years after stopping teriflunomide. More real world data are necessary to assess effectiveness and long term safety.

AB: PURPOSE: Aflibercept has the potential advantage of reducing capacity problems by allowing 2 monthly visits for patients with neovascular macular degeneration (nAMD) compared with monthly pro re nata regimens that are the most commonly used in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to report the visual outcomes achieved in routine clinical practice using the VEGF Trap‐Eye: Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet AMD (VIEW) protocol at 1 year and compare with trials data and other real‐world reports. DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis from an electronic medical record. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive series of treatment‐naïve patients initiated on aflibercept for nAMD at least 1 year before data extraction. METHODS: Data were anonymized and remotely extracted from 16 centers in the United Kingdom that use the same electronic medical record (EMR) system (Medisoft Ophthalmology; Medisoft Limited, Leeds, UK). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The minimum data set defined before first data entry and mandated by the EMR included age, gender, visual acuity, injection episodes, and complications. RESULTS: The mean age was 80.0 years (median, 81.0 years) and 63.7% were women. During the first year of treatment with aflibercept, 1840 treatment‐naïve eyes of 1682 patients received a median of 8 (mean, 7.0) injections at a median of 8 (mean, 7.3) visits. The mean baseline visual acuity was 53.7 letters, improving to 58.8 letters (+5.1‐letter gain) at 1 year. In first‐treated eyes, the respective figures were 52.7 letters at baseline and 58.2 letters at 1 year, a gain of +5.5 letters. The proportion achieving 70 letters or more increased from 16.4% at baseline to 33.7% at 1 year, and 92% avoided moderate visual loss at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The visual acuity outcomes are comparable to randomized trials and better than many previous real‐world data collections, with a mean +5.1‐letter gain at 1 year compared with +8.4 letters in the integrated analysis of the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies. Early visual gains were maintained through the year. Collection of outcomes beyond clinical trials can have limitations but better reflect the full pool of patients actually treated and are important to determine whether a particular treatment is performing as expected. Such data also have the potential to improve services by setting up a mechanism to compare sites.

AB: Introduction: Analyses from AVF2107g trial of bevacizumab found clinical benefit in both mutant and wild‐type KRAS patients. However, real world data on PFS and OS of bevacizumab‐treated patients by KRAS status from a community setting is lacking. Thus a retrospective analysis to understand patient and treatment characteristics (for first line and second line treatments), and clinical outcomes, among mCRC patients with KRAS wild‐type (wt) and KRAS mutant (mut) treated with 1st line (1L) chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (BV) was undertaken. Methods: Data was derived from the US Oncology's iKnowMed electronic medical record system. mCRC patients ( pts) who received a chemotherapy regimen in the 1L of therapy with BV between June 1st, 2008 and Oct 31st, 2009 were identified. The study index date was defined as the start of 1L therapy. Pts were followed until death or loss to follow up, whichever came first. For the analysis pts were divided into 2 cohorts: KRAS‐wt and KRAS‐mut. Clinical outcomes were measured by progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS is defined as time from initiation of 1L Tx to initiation of 2L Tx or death using start of 2L therapy as a proxy for progression, OS is defined as time from initiation of 1L Tx to death. Descriptive analysis was used to describe baseline demographic and treatment characteristics, overall survival and progression‐free survival were conducted with Kaplan‐Meier method to describe clinical outcomes. Results: Of the 272 bevacizumab‐treated patients in this community setting, 157 (58%) were identified as KRAS‐wt and 115 (42%) were identified as KRAS‐mut. Patient characteristics and chemotherapy regimen between groups were similar. In both KRAS‐wt and KRAS‐mut cohorts, 59% of patients were treated 1L with FOLFOX+BV and 19% were treated with FOLFIRI+BV. First‐line median PFS was 11.8 months 95% CI (10.3‐13.9) for KRAS‐wt patients and 14.9 months 95% CI (12.3‐16.9) for KRAS‐mut patients. Median OS was 24.6 months 95% CI (21.2‐30.7) for KRAS‐wt and 27.6 months 95% CI (24.2‐35.1) for KRAS‐mut patients. 2L anti‐EGFR therapy was used in 47 (42%) of KRAS‐wt patients. In 2L, 22% of KRAS‐wt patients and 29% of KRAS‐mut patients were treated with FOLFIRI+BV. Conclusion: In this descriptive analysis, mCRC patients treated in the community setting with bevacizumab, the observed clinical outcomes in PFS and OS were not statistically different between KRAS‐wt and KRAS‐mut pts, which may be due to more variable practice type and treatment options in the community setting. Further research from randomized, controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings.

DOI: 10.1177/1352458517731404
AB: Background: Delayed‐release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and fingolimod (FNG) are two approved oral drugs for relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Although the European Medicine Agency recommends different indications for DMF and FNG, both drugs are sometime used either as switch strategy in patients who do not respond to self‐injectable drugs or as first treatment option. However, real world data reporting direct comparison of their effectiveness are still scarce. Objective: To directly compare the effectiveness of DMF and FNG in achieving the No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA‐3) status, defined as absence of relapses, disability worsening and magnetic resonance imaging activity. Methods: We analyzed data of patients with RRMS regularly attending 7 MS Clinics in Central Italy and who started DMF or FNG as first treatment (naives) or were switched from a selfinjectable drugs (switchers). To be included, patients were required to have had at least one relapse in the year prior to DMF or FNG start, no previous exposure to either monoclonal antibodies or immunosuppressants, minimum 3‐month persistence on DMF and FNG. Since patients were not randomized to treatment group, we performed a propensity score (PS)‐based nearest neighbour matching within a calliper of 0.05 to select only patients with similar baseline characteristics. Pairwise comparisons were then conducted in matched samples using a Cox proportional hazards model (stratified by Centre) with the NEDA‐3 as main outcome. Pairwise censoring was adopted to adjust for difference in length of follow‐up among the two treatment groups. Results: Overall, 426 and 469 patients started DMF and FNG, respectively. There was significant imbalance in pre‐matching baseline characteristics across treatment groups, due to the lower EDSS score, fewer pre‐treatment relapses and active MRI scans in DMF group (p‐values< 0.001). A total of 550 patients (275 per group) was retained by the PS‐matching procedure. After a median on‐study follow‐up of 18 months, we found a trend toward a better outcome (NEDA‐3) for FNG over DMF (HR=0.76, p=0.07). Subgroup analyses showed a comparable effectiveness of the two drugs in naives (n=198; HR=0.88, p=0.96), while FNG was superior to DMF in the achievement of NEDA‐3 status in switchers (n=352; HR=0.62, p=0.02). Discussion: Our study suggests that DMF is as effective as FNG in naive patients, while FNG could be a better option for patients switching from a self‐injectable drug.

AB: Objective: The Trevo Registry was designed to assess real world outcomes of the Trevo Retriever in patients experiencing ischemic stroke. It is the largest prospective study for acute stroke intervention, with 2010 patients enrolled and 90 day outcomes in 1873 patients. The primary endpoint is revascularization status based on post‐procedure TICI score and secondary endpoints include 90‐day mRS, 90‐day mortality, neurological deterioration at 24 hours and device/procedure related adverse events. Methods: The study was a prospective, open‐label, consecutive enrollment, multi‐center, international registry of patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke using the Trevo stent retriever as the initial device. Results: The median NIHSS at admission was 16 (IQR 11‐20). Most patients (70.8%) were treated at <= 6 hours from last known normal with a median procedure time of 50 minutes (32‐77). The occlusion site was M1 or M2 in 73.9%. General anesthesia was employed in 43.5% of procedures. TICI 2b or 3 revascularization was 92.8% with an average of 1.7 passes with the device. Median NIHSS at 24 hours and discharge was 6 and 4 respectively. Fifty‐five percent (55.2%) of patients had mRS <=2 at 3 months and the overall mortality rate was 13.8%. Patients treated after 8 hours of symptom onset had a 95% revascularization rate and 51.2% mRS <=2 at 3 months. The symptomatic ICH rate was 1.6%. Patients who met the revised AHA criteria for thrombectomy were found to have 59.5% mRS 0‐2 at 90 days. Conclusions: The Trevo Retriever Registry represents the first real world data with stent retriever use in the era of clinical trials showing the overwhelming benefit of stent retrievers to treat acute ischemic stroke. Due to the fact that this data represents real world use of the Trevo Retriever, (e.g. subjects pre‐stroke mRS >1 (29%) and those treated 6‐24 hours after stroke symptoms (29%), this data cannot be compared to the results from recent trials with restricted eligibility criteria. Future subgroup analysis of this large cohort will help to identify areas of future research to enhance outcomes further with this treatment modality.

AB: Background: It is estimated that within ten years of primary treatment for prostate cancer up to 40% of patients post radical prostatectomy, and up to 50% of patients post radiotherapy will develop disease recurrence. While monitoring of PSA levels is informative of biochemical recurrence, it may precede radiologically detectable recurrence by months to years, and cannot differentiate local/regional recurrence from systemic disease. This represents a management dilemma for treating physicians. The incorporation of PET probes targeting prostate‐specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for prostate cancer shows promise for improving the management of patients with prostate cancer, when used alongside existing imaging techniques, like CT, MRI and bone scans. Methods: Retrospective review of all patients referred from our institution for PSMA imaging was carried out. Baseline clinical features were determined and we analyzed impact of PSMA imaging on management outcomes and survival data. Results: 33 patients referred for 68Ga‐PSMA‐PET imaging were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 65 years (51‐75). The indication for referral in all patients was biochemical recurrence in the absence of radiological evidence of disease by CT imaging and bone scan. Median PSA at time of referral for PSMA scan was 7.3ug/L (1.4ug/L to 87.7ug/L). 100% of patients (n = 33) were upstaged following PSMA imaging, and 30% (n = 10) had more than one site of metastatic disease identified. Most common sites of metastasis were lymph node and bone. Median number of sites of metastatic disease identified by PSMA imaging was one. These results led to a change in management for 96% patients (n = 32). All patients at the time of this review are alive with a median follow up of 13 months, and median progression‐free survival of 11 months. Conclusions: PSMA PET‐CT directly led to an alteration in the treatment of the majority of patients in this study. This real world data reflects the growing role of PSMA imaging in influencing clinical decisions for prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence. Prospective data from randomized studies are awaited to further validate the role of PSMA PET‐CT in this patient cohort.

AB: Background: Budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate (BF) Spiromax is a multidose dry‐powder inhaler licensed in Europe since 2014 for the management of asthma and COPD in patients (pts) aged >18 years. This prospective, open‐label, multi‐centre, phase 4, non‐interventional, observational study was conducted in Germany, as recommended by the local regulatory authorities, to collect post‐approval data on pt satisfaction and preference, and ease of use with BF Spiromax within the labelled indication. Method: Pts were adults with asthma or COPD, for whom an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long‐acting b2 agonist (LABA) combination was indicated, and who were scheduled to commence treatment/switch treatment to BF Spiromax. Physician rationale for prescribing/switching to BF Spiromax was determined at Visit 1 (Week 1). Pts were assessed at Visit 1 and at Weeks 4 and 12 for their Satisfaction With Inhalers and Preference (SWIP) questionnaire and inhalation technique/handling errors. Here, we report ad interim on the patients' device preference and satisfaction findings of the study. Results: 2500 pts were enrolled, 1891 pts completed Visit 1 (44% male, mean age 56.8 years, 67%/33% with asthma/COPD diagnosis). 1305 pts (with completed electronic case‐report forms [e‐CRFs]) completed the study. SWIP data (not part of the e‐CRF) were available for 578 pts at Week 1 and for 449 pts at Week 12. Prior to starting BF Spiromax, 50% of pts were receiving an ICS/LABA combination (56% on BF Turbuhaler). The main reasons cited by physicians for prescribing/switching to BF Spiromax were: low requirement for training (46%), one‐step inhalation (41%) and anticipated improvement in adherence (36%). Results from the SWIP questionnaire indicated that 65% were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with Spiromax at Week 1; this increased to 91% by Week 12. 58% of pts preferred BF Spiromax to their old inhaler at Week 12. The most common observed errors were 'not exhaling fully before inhalation' (20% [116/580] Week 1; 10% [47/486] Week 12) followed by 'Inhalation is not as strong as possible from the beginning' (18% [102/580] Week 1, 9% [46/486] Week 12). At the end of the observation period (Week 12), 88% of pts continued treatment with BF Spiromax. Conclusion: These real‐world data suggest that pt satisfaction with BF Spiromax was high and increased from Week 1 through Week 12, with more adult pts indicating a preference for BF Spiromax over their previous inhaler.

AB: Background: The multi‐dose dry‐powder inhaler, budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate (BF) Spiromax, was licensed in Europe in 2014 for the management of asthma and COPD in adults for whom an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long‐acting b2 agonist (LABA) combination is recommended. As part of a prospective, openlabel, multi‐centre, phase 4, non‐interventional, observational study, and following German regulatory authority recommendations, the clinical efficacy of BF Spiromax was evaluated. Method: Adult patients (pts) with asthma or COPD who were scheduled to commence treatment/switch to BF Spiromax at the physician's discretion, were included. Pts attended clinic visits in Weeks 1, 4 and 12 during which vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), asthma symptoms/control [Asthma Control Test (ACT) questionnaire], COPD symptoms/severity [COPD assessment test (CAT) questionnaire], clinical global impression (CGI) scale, and rescue medication use were recorded. Clinical efficacy findings are reported herein (data cut‐off: 25 August 2015). Results: 2500 pts were enrolled. Of these, 1891 pts completed Visit 1 (Week 1): 44% male, mean age 56.8 years, 67%/33% with asthma/COPD. 1305 pts completed the study. In pts with available data, vital capacity increased from a mean of 82% at Week 1 to 85% at Week 12 and FEV1 (% predicted) improved from a mean of 74% at Week 1 to 77% at Week 12. In asthma pts, symptom control improved during the study, with the proportion of controlled pts increasing from 34% at Week 1 to 60% at Week 12. Symptoms similarly improved in COPD pts: 30% assessed as 'severe' or 'very severe' at Week 1, decreasing to 26% at Week 12. Based on the CGI scale, the proportion of pts assessed as 'considerably ill' decreased from 20% at Week 1 to 12% at Week 12. After 12 weeks of treatment, 33% of pts were assessed as having a 'little better' or 'much better' overall health status compared with the time of commencing BF Spiromax. The proportion of pts requiring rescue medication at least once daily decreased from 25% at Week 1 to 8% at Week 12 (proportion requiring use >3 times a day decreased from 8% to 1%, respectively). Conclusion: These real‐world data suggest that measures of lung function, asthma control, COPD severity, CGI and rescue medication requirement are improved in asthma/COPD pts following 12 weeks' use of BF Spiromax.

AB: Rationale: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a non‐pharmacologic, device‐based treatment for subjects >=18 years with severe persistent asthma not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long‐acting beta‐agonists (LABA). The "Post‐FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma" (PAS2 study) collects real‐world data on subjects undergoing BT treatment with the Alair BT System. We report for the first time baseline and follow‐up results for the primary and secondary endpoints to 2 years. Methods: The PAS2 study is a prospective, open‐label, observational, multi‐center trial at US and Canadian centers. Subjects 18‐65 years taking ICS >=1000mug/day (beclomethasone or equivalent) and LABA >=80mug/day (salmeterol or equivalent) were enrolled. Additional inclusion criteria were: pre‐bronchodilator FEV1 >=60% predicted, non‐smoker for >=1 year (<10 pack/years if former smoker), >=2 days with asthma symptoms in the last 4 weeks, AQLQ <=6.25, and in the 12 months prior to BT treatment have <=2 hospitalizations, <=3 lower respiratory tract infections, and <=3 severe exacerbations. Subjects diagnosed with other severe respiratory diseases were excluded. Baseline demographics, AQLQ, medication usage, FEV1 and FVC, medical history, comorbidities, and 12‐month baseline recall data (severe exacerbations and healthcare utilization) were recorded. Following BT, severe exacerbations, hospitalization, and ER visits, as well as FEV1 and FVC, were evaluated for each subject at 1 and 2 years post‐therapy. Results: Two‐hundred eighty‐four subjects were enrolled at 27 centers; 279 subjects had at least 1 of 3 BT procedures; 271 subjects had all 3 BT procedures. Subjects had mean age 45.7 years with 64.5% female and mean BMI 32.2kg/m2. Mean ICS dose was 2269mug/day, LABA dose was 74mug/day, and SABA dose was 2.35mug/day at baseline. Baseline mean AQLQ was 4.03 with a mean of 25.2 years since asthma diagnosis. In the 12 months prior to first BT procedure, 78% of subjects had at least one severe exacerbation (mean 1.6/subject), 16% had hospitalizations, and 29% had ER visits. In the first and second year of follow‐up, 50.6% and 45.4% of subjects had severe exacerbations, respectively. Similarly, 14.4% and 12.7% of subjects had hospitalizations in the first and second year of follow‐up, and 18.3% and 13.5% of subjects had ER visits in the first and second year of follow‐up. Conclusion: The PAS2 study shows that compared to the year prior to BT treatment, in the 2 years after BT treatment study subjects experienced improved asthma control with respect to severe exacerbations, hospitalizations and ER visits.

AB: Background: HCV genotype 1 has been known to be the most common and difficult to treat genotype worldwide under the treatment of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The enhanced antiviral activity achieved by combining two direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) agents, daclatasvir and asunaprevir, has been studied and represent the treatment of choice in this population. However, there is a lack of real‐world data of the treatment efficacy and safety of the combined drug in Korean patients. Methods: A total of 231 HCV genotype 1b patients treated with daclatasvir 60 mg once daily and asunaprevir 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks were retrospectively reviewed from 4 centers of the Gwang‐ Ju/Jeon Nam province from August 2015 to October 2016. The treatment efficacy (HCV RNA<25 IU/mL at post‐treatment week 12 (SVR12)) of the combined treatment was the primary endpoint for the analysis. Various clinical parameters including patient demographics, Child‐Pugh score, presence of baseline resistance associated variants (RAV), HCV RNA, and adverse effects to treatment were analyzed. Result: This study included 176 treatment‐naive patients (76.2%), 43 nonresponders (18.6%), and 12 intolerable/ineligible (5.2%) patients to previous treatment of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The presence for RAV at baseline was positive in 9 patients (3.9%) among the tested 223 patients (96.5%). The proportion of patients with SVR12 was 87.9% (87/99). Prominent alanine/aspartate aminotransferase increase (>200 U/L) was noted in 1 patient (0.4%). Fatigue (9.1%), headache (4.8%), nausea (3.9%), asthenia (2.2%) and diarrhea (0.8%) were noted but did not lead to discontinuation of therapy. The presence of RAV at baseline was predictive of lower SVR12 rates (p<0.001). Patients with positive HCV RNA at week 8 of treatment had a significant risk of not achieveing SVR12 (p = 0.030). Conclusion: In HCV genotype 1b infected patients in Korea, Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir is well tolerated and provide high sustained virologic response. Presence of baseline RAV and positive HCV RNA values at week 8 of treatment were predicting factors related to poor treatment response. Further studies to validate these findings were needed.

AB: Background: Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit alpha4beta7 integrin and result in gut‐selective anti‐inflammatory activity. Randomised control trials have shown VDZ to be safe and effective in treating patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, real‐world data describing the outcome of VDZ therapy in routine clinical practice are limited. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VDZ in routine clinical practice. Methods: A multicentre, retrospective study across seven Irish academic hospitals in the INITIATIVE Network was conducted. N = 68 eligible UC patients were identified with n = 39 having at least 6 months of follow‐up included in the final study cohort. Demographics and disease characteristics were collected at baseline, and 3 and 6 months following VDZ initiation. VDZ was administered as per standard protocol. Primary endpoints were 3‐month clinical response and 6‐month steroid‐free remission. Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in clinical Mayo subscore of >=3 points, with ongoing receipt of VDZ. Clinical remission was defined as a clinical Mayo subscore of <=1, the absence of corticosteroid use and continuing receipt of VDZ. Secondary endpoints were baseline variables associated with VDZ induction outcome and rates of adverse events. Results: Thirty‐nine patients were included in the final study cohort. Baseline characteristics included (median [range]): age 44 [17‐79]; gender 58% male; 61% extensive and 39% left‐sided colitis; median clinical Mayo subscore at initiation 6 [2‐9]; CRP 8 mg/l [0.8‐85 mg/l) and median albumin 37 g/l (20‐47 g/l). At VDZ initiation proportions receiving 5‐aminosalicylates; thiopurines and systemic corticosteroids were 67%, 48%, and 50%, respectively. 24%, 35%, and 41% had been exposed to no, 1 and 2 anti‐TNF agents, respectively. Three‐month clinical response and 6‐month steroid‐free clinical remission rates were 47% and 46% respectively. Comparing anti‐TNF naive and exposed individuals; 3 months response rates was similar (40% vs. 48% respectively, p = 0.73); however, there was a trend toward increased 6 months steroid‐free remission rates (75% vs. 35%, respectively, p = 0.10). Regression analysis demonstrated no baseline clinical or biochemical variable to be associated with 3‐month clinical response or 6‐month steroid‐free remission. The rate of adverse events was 6.1%, none requiring hospitalisation. Conclusions: These data support the efficacy and safety of VDZ as an induction and maintenance agent in UC. Consistent with published literature the long‐term outcome of VDZ therapy appears improved in anti‐TNF naive cohorts.

AB: Background: Idursulfase therapy (Shire) for the life‐limiting disorder MPS II (Hunter syndrome) has been available since 2006; its impact on survival has not been evaluated Methods: Kaplan‐Meier (K‐M) estimates and Cox regression modelling were used to compare survival in idursulfase‐treated and untreated male patients followed prospectively in HOS, a global, multicentre registry that collects real‐world data on MPS II. Median values are shown unless otherwise specified Results: As of January 2016, data were available for 768 idursulfase‐treated (treatment duration, 55.8 months) and 96 untreated patients. Age at symptom onset was 1.5 yrs in both groups; age at diagnosis was 3.3 and 3.2 yrs in treated and untreated patients, respectively. Prevalence of cognitive impairment was also similar (treated 57.2 %; untreated 58.3 %; p = 0.536). 15.2 % of treated and 26.0 % of untreated patients had died. K‐M survival estimates (95 % CI) were 33.0 (30.6‐42.2) yrs in treated and 21.2 (18.0‐not reached [NR]) yrs in untreated patients (log rank p = 0.016); follow‐up was 12.7 and 13.9 yrs. In those with cognitive impairment, survival was 20.9 (19.4‐23.9) and 18.0 (15.4‐21.2) yrs in treated and untreated patients; in those without cognitive impairment, values were 43.6 (34.6‐NR) yrs in treated patients and NR in untreated patients (only 2 events). A Cox model adjusted for cognitive impairment, region, and ages at diagnosis and symptom onset indicated a 49%lower risk of death in treated patients: adjusted death hazard ratio 0.51 (95 % CI: 0.31‐0.84). Conversely, risk of death was 1.96‐fold higher in untreated patients Discussion: The modelwill be further refined by exploring additional potential confounding factors to obtain improved estimates of survival in treated and untreated patients with MPS II. This first report of improved survival with long‐term idursulfase therapy is a valuable addition to our evolving understanding of patient management.

AB: Introduction Non‐invasive assessment of liver fibrosis with elastography is increasingly used as the sole diagnostic method to assess patients with HCV infection for suitability for new anti‐viral therapies. Currently patients with cirrhosis form the majority of those funded for some oral treatments in England. A large proportion reside in London and the South East region. As shear velocity cut offs for Metavir F4 fibrosis with the ARFI technique (virtual touch quantification, VTqTM) are based upon historical studies, which may have been subject to sources of bias, there is a need for disease specific, population adjusted data. We report the results of a biopsy controlled study from two centres, designed to investigate optimal ARFI cut‐offs for determining cirrhosis in our population. Methods Our database of 96 patients with HCV infection obtained from two centres was interrogated. ARFI shear velocity (SV) estimation was performed with 10 right lobe measurements. Fibrosis stage was confirmed in 84 by right lobe liver biopsy within 2 hours of ARFI, and cirrhosis was confirmed by B‐mode US imaging criteria in the remaining 12. Ultrasonic and histopathological data was collated retrospectively. Diagnostic performance of ARFI was determined by ROC analysis, using a) reference SV cut‐off values for Metavir stage, and b) optimal SV thresholds for cirrhosis derived from our local data, including subgroup analysis. Results Three subgroups were analysed: 1) all 96 cases, including 20 patients with co‐pathology (HBV, NAFLD, or ALD); 2) 76 cases with HCV only; 3) 84 cases who had simultaneous biopsy. Cirrhosis was present in 26, 20 and 14, respectively. Predictive accuracy for Metavir F4 using the reference threshold of 1.75 m/sec was 90%, 92% and 88% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Using new thresholds and ARFI mean SVs required a higher cutoff of 1.99 in group 1 compared with 1.64 in groups 2 and 3 to achieve accuracies of 87%‐93%, whereas more consistent performance across all groups was achieved with median SVs at a cutoff of 1.89, achieving accuracies of 93%, 96% and 92%, respectively. Conclusion These "real world" data confirm the high predictive accuracy of ARFI for Metavir F4 cirrhosis in our local HCV cohort. Optimal performance was seen for median SV cutoff of 1.89 m/sec. However, adjustment of diagnostic thresholds may be necessary when making treatment decisions for less selected populations and in those patients with coexistent pathology.

AB: Background: The Post‐ureteroscopic Lesion Scale (PULS) was designed as a standardized classification system for ureteral lesions after uretero(reno)scopy (URS). This study evaluates its routine use and a possible clinical impact based on a representative patient cohort. Materials and methods: Data of 307 patients in 14 German centers within the BUSTER project were used to test 3 hypotheses (H): PULS score shows a high interrater reliability (IRR) after independent assessment by urologic surgeon and assistance personnel (H1); PULS score is correlated with the frequency of postoperative complications during hospital stay (H2); post‐URS stenting of the ureter is associated with higher PULS scores (H3). Results: Median age of patients was 54.4 years (interquartile range [IQR] 44.4‐65.8; 65.5% male). Median diameter of index stones was 6 mm (IQR 4‐8) with 117 (38.4%) pyelo‐caliceal and 188 (61.6%) ureteral stones. Overall, 70 and 82.4% of patients had pre‐stenting and post‐URS stenting, respectively. Stone‐free status was achieved in 68.7% after one URS procedure with a complication rate of 10.8% (mostly grade 1‐2 according to Clavien‐Dindo). PULS scores 0, 1, 2 and 3 were assessed in 40%, 52.1%, 6.9% and 1% of patients, respectively, when estimated by urologic surgeons. PULS score showed a high IRR between the urologic surgeon and assistance personnel (kappa = 0.883, p < 0.001), but was not significantly correlated with complications (rho = 0.09, p = 0.881). In contrast, a significant positive correlation was found between PULS score and post‐URS stenting (rho = 0.287, p < 0.001). A PULS score of 1 multiplied the likelihood of post‐URS stenting by 3.24 (95% confidence interval 1.43‐7.34; p = 0.005) as opposed to PULS score 0. Conclusions: Removal of upper urinary tract stones using URS is safe and efficacious. Real‐world data provided by this study confirm a high IRR of the PULS score and its clinical impact on the indication for post‐URS stenting. A future prospective randomized trial should evaluate a possible standardization of post‐URS stenting based on PULS score assessment.

AB: Background: Methotrexate (MTX) remains the anchor drug in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, but is poorly tolerated or contraindicated in some patients. There is a wealth of data supporting the use of abatacept in combination with MTX, but data on alternative conventional synthetic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) combinations with abatacept are scarce. Methods: In this post‐hoc exploratory analysis, efficacy and safety data were extracted from abatacept RA studies in which combination with csDMARDs other than MTX was permitted: three interventional trials (ATTAIN, ASSURE, and ARRIVE) and one real‐world study (ACTION). Patients with moderate‐to‐severe RA received abatacept in combination with MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, or leflunomide for 6 months to 2 years according to the study design. Change from baseline in physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire‐Disability Index (HAQ‐DI); all studies) and 28‐joint Disease Activity Score (C‐reactive protein) (DAS28 (CRP); ATTAIN, ARRIVE, and ACTION), American College of Rheumatology response rates (ATTAIN), and safety were assessed for individual and pooled csDMARD combinations for each trial. A meta‐analysis was also performed on pooled data for HAQ‐DI and DAS28 (CRP) across interventional trials. Results: Across all four studies, 731 patients received abatacept plus one non‐MTX csDMARD (hydroxychloroquine n = 152; sulfasalazine n = 123; azathioprine n = 59; and leflunomide n = 397) and 2382 patients received abatacept plus MTX. Mean changes from baseline in HAQ‐DI scores for abatacept plus MTX (all csDMARDs pooled) vs abatacept plus a non‐MTX csDMARD were ‐0.54 vs ‐0.44 (ATTAIN), ‐0.43 vs ‐0.43 (ASSURE), and ‐0.39 vs ‐0.36 (ARRIVE). Mean changes from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) and ACR response rates were also similar with abatacept plus MTX or non‐MTX csDMARDs. Data for individual non‐MTX csDMARDs (pooled across studies) and real‐world data were consistent with these findings. Rates of treatment‐related adverse events and serious adverse events, respectively, for abatacept plus one non‐MTX csDMARD vs abatacept plus MTX were 35.7% vs 41.7% and 2.4% vs 2.3% (ATTAIN), 58.0% vs 55.9% and 4.2% vs 1.7% (ASSURE), and 38.1% vs 44.3% and 0.6% vs 2.9% (ARRIVE). Conclusions: Abatacept in combination with non‐MTX csDMARDs is clinically effective and well tolerated in patients with moderate‐to‐severe RA, providing similar benefits to those seen with abatacept plus MTX.

AB: Objective: We evaluated endovascular therapy (EVT) outcomes in patients no studied in the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) compared to counterparts represented in the RCTs. Background: The efficacy of EVT in RCTs for acute strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) led to AHA guidelines recommending EVT as standard of care for selected patients. However, many subpopulations were under‐represented in the RCTs: ASPECTS <6, age >80 yo, NIHSS <6, onset to treatment >6 hrs and M2/distal/posterior circulation occlusions. Design/Methods: A multicenter international prospective study of LVO patients treated with stent retriever thrombectomy (TREVO Registry) between 11/2013 and 4/2016 was analyzed. 90 day mRS was the primary outcome (0‐2 good outcome). Multivariate logistic regression modeling was employed to evaluate EVT impact. Results: Of 1000 enrolled patients, 81 had NIHSS <6 and 81.5% of those achieved a good outcome (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9‐6.8; p<0.001) compared with NIHSS >6. Patients over 80 years old, however, had the lowest odds of independence (32.1%) (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2‐0.5; p<0.001) compared with <80 yo. Among 212 patients treated >6 hrs, 51% had a good outcome (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55‐1.1; p=0.17) compared to <6 hrs. Nearly half of patients (48.3%) with ASPECTS <6 (3‐5) had a good outcome. There were low rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage for treated patients with NIHSS<6, age>80, ASPECTS <6 or treatment >6 hrs. Middle cerebral artery‐M2 segment and distal occlusions had the highest good outcome probabilities, 59.9 and 60% respectively, while proximal ICAs had the lowest (48.1%). More than half of vertebrobasilar patients achieved independence (54.8%). Conclusions: While effectiveness cannot be determined in the absence of medically‐treated controls, our analyses of real world data show several groups outside AHA guidelines may benefit from EVT. In particular, further study is needed to examine EVT benefits for mild stroke and M2 occlusions.

AB: Background: The efficacy of catheter‐based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) in terms of blood pressure (BP) reduction has been questioned, while "real‐world" data from registries are needed. The aim of the present study was to report the complete set of 12 month data on office and ambulatory BP changes as well as to investigate predictors for BP response to RDN from a national registry. Methods: In 4 Greek hospital centers 68 patients (age: 58+/‐10 years, 49 males, body mass index: 33.1+/‐5 kg/m2, 4.3+/‐1.0 antihypertensive drugs) with drug resistant hypertension underwent RDN and were followed‐up for 12 months. At baseline, the average office BP and 24‐ hour ambulatory BP were 174+/‐17/95+/‐13 mmHg and 158+/‐17/90+/‐13 mmHg respectively. Bilateral RDN was performed using percutaneous femoral approach and standardized techniques. Results: Reductions in office systolic/diastolic BP at 6 and 12 months from baseline were ‐30/‐12 mmHg and ‐29/‐12 mmHg, while the reductions in 24‐hour ambulatory BP were ‐16/‐9 mmHg and ‐15/‐9 mmHg respectively (p<0.05 for all). A correlation analysis revealed that baseline office systolic BP was related to the extent of office systolic BP drop and baseline ambulatory systolic BP was related to the extent of ambulatory BP drop. Patients that were RDN responders (85%, n=58), defined as an at least 10 mmHg decrease in office systolic BP at 24 months, compared to non‐responders were younger (57+/‐9 vs 65+/‐8 years, p<0.05), had higher baseline office systolic BP (176+/‐17 vs 160+/‐11 mmHg, p<0.05) and 24h systolic BP (159+/‐13 vs 149+/‐11 mmHg, p<0.05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that age and baseline office systolic BP were independent predictors of RDN response (p<0.05 for both). At 12 months there were no significant changes in renal function and no new serious device or procedure related adverse events. Conclusions: In our 'real‐world' multicenter national registry, the efficacy of renal denervation in reducing BP as well as safety is proven during a 12 months follow‐up. Moreover, younger age and higher levels of baseline office systolic BP are independently related to better BP response to RDN.

AB: Introduction: Real‐world data are critical to demonstrate the consistency of evidence and external generalizability of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This study examined characteristics and outcomes of metastatic triple‐negative breast cancer (mTNBC) patients treated with eribulin mesylate at community oncology practices in the United States. Methods: Physicians identified mTNBC patients initiating eribulin between 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2014 and abstracted data into an electronic case report form (eCRF). Eribulin treatment in the metastatic setting was categorized as early use (EU, first‐/second‐line) and late use (LU, third‐line or later). Patient characteristics, overall survival (OS), disease response (per treating physician), and adverse events (AEs) rates in each group, respectively, are reported. Results: Overall 252 eCRFs were completed: 125 (49.6%) EU and 127 (50.4%) LU. The median age at metastatic diagnosis was 53 years and 42.1% were stage IV at their initial diagnosis. The median duration of follow‐up from the initiation of first‐line treatment was 24 months. Rates of disease response (complete or partial per treating physician) were 69.9% in the EU group and 48.8% in the LU group. The five most commonly reported adverse events during eribulin were as follows: fatigue (65.1%), weakness (40.1%), decreased appetite (32.5%), neutropenia (31.0%), and leukopenia (27.4%). Discontinuation of eribulin due to AE was observed in 4.0% of patients. Median OS from initiation of eribulin was 23.0 months (95% CI: 18.7‐27.3) among EU and 14.7 (95% CI: 12.6‐16.9) among LU. Conclusion: In the real‐world eribulin‐treated mTNBC, patients have more sites of metastatic disease and exposure to greater numbers of prior therapies compared to RCTs. The median OS of 14.7 months among LU patients is consistent with, and slightly longer than the 13.1 months and 14.4 months reported in the EMBRACE and Study 301 clinical trials, respectively.

AB: Background: This single‐arm, non‐interventional study ML28306 aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and safety of 1L Bevacizumab (BEV) treatment, focusing on 4 defined age groups, with platinum‐based chemotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the lung in routine practice. Methods: The study is fully recruited with 1107 patients in 174 centers. 990 patients who received >1 BEV‐dose to date are included in the present analysis. Enrollment started 02/2013; last patient out is expected 06/2017. Baseline characteristics, treatment regimen, effectiveness and safety data are documented for each patient. Primary endpoint is progression‐free survival (PFS). Results: In terms of age, 34% of patients were <60, 37% were 60‐69, 26% were 70‐79 and 3% were >80 years. The analysis population consisted of 59% males. 35% of patients were active smokers, 47% ex‐smokers. At baseline, 91% of patients had ECOG status <1, none >4, and 92% had stage IV disease. The most common BEV‐dosages in cycle 1 were 7.5mg/kg (67.3%) and 15mg/kg (29.0%). For the entire patient population the median PFS (mPFS) was 6.9 months (m) (95% CI; 6.5 ‐ 7.3) and the median OS (mOS) was 12.5m (95% CI; 10.9 ‐ 13.6) from initiation of BEV‐treatment. The mPFS and mOS were similar across age groups. For the four age groups mPFS (95% CI) was 6.7m (6.0 ‐ 7.3), 6.8m (6.3 ‐ 7.5), 7.2m (6.5 ‐ 7.8) and 8.5m (3.1 ‐ 10.5), respectively. There were 4431 documented adverse events (AE) in 765 (77.5%) patients, thereof 705 serious AE (SAE) in 351 (35.5%) patients. According to investigator assessment 339 AE in 194 (19.7%) and 103 SAE in 82 (8.3%) patients were BEV‐related. Due to an AE, BEV‐treatment was discontinued in 191 (19.4%) patients and 64 (6.5%) died. Conclusions: Effectiveness and safety data of the 2. interim analysis is in line with results of the 1. analysis and other real‐world data on BEV. The mPFS of the present study is comparable to the mPFS of 6.6m of the controlled E4599 trial, while the mOS is slightly lower (12.5m vs 14.2m). The safety profile is similar across age groups. No new safety signals were observed. Elderly patients seem to benefit in the same way as younger ones.

AB: Background: The direct‐acting antiviral regimen of ombitasvir (OBV), paritaprevir (identified by AbbVie and Enanta, co‐dosed with ritonavir [PTV/r]) +/‐ dasabuvir (DSV) +/‐ ribavirin (RBV) was approved in 2015 in Europe for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 (GT1) or 4 (GT4) infection. To this date, real‐world data as well as data on patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) on this regimen are limited. Goals: In this study, we investigated PROs in real‐world for the treatment regimen of OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV. Methods: GT1 and GT4‐infected patients, participating in the multi‐center, non‐interventional cohort study REAL (NCT02582658) in Austria, were included in this analysis. Patients received the regimen of OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV according to the local label. Effectiveness was assessed by SVR12. Health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), health/disease awareness and work productivity were assessed by standardized questionnaires (EQ‐5D‐5L; WPAI Hep C V2.0; PAM‐13). Results: As of March 31 2016, a total of 151 patients received the regimen of OBV/PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV. Baseline characteristics are shown in the table. Assessment of HRQoL by EQ‐5D‐5L showed no major differences in index scores in the total population at baseline (BL; mean: 0.827; SD: 0.177; n = 117) and end of treatment (EOT; mean: 0.885; SD: 0.121; n = 48). For patients with available data at both time points (n = 42), mean change in index score was 0.006 (SD: 0.135), indicating that there was no reduction of HRQoL due to treatment. Analysis of total activity impairment scores by WPAI revealed no significant differences between BL (mean 24.4; SD: 26.7; n = 115) and EOT (mean 24.5; SD: 28.6; n = 44) as well, suggesting that treatment did not adversely affect total activity of patients. Upcoming results (including SVR12 data) will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: In this study, the treatment with OBV/ PTV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ RBV did not adversely impact HRQoL and total activity of patients in a real‐world setting in Austria, confirming previous results on the tolerability of this regimen.

AB: Introduction/Background: LUMINOUS (NCT01318941), a 5‐year observational global study, evaluated the long‐term safety, effectiveness, treatment patterns, and health‐related quality of life outcomes of ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment in patients with agerelated macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) in a real‐world setting. Here we present the baseline characteristics of patients from the final analysis of the LUMINOUS study. Methods: LUMINOUS, a prospective, multi‐centre, non‐interventional, open‐label study (initiated in March 2011), recruited more than 30,000 patients from 494 sites across 43 countries. Consenting adult (>=18 years) patients who were treatment‐naive or previously treated with ranibizumab or other ocular treatments, were enrolled and treated with ranibizumab for the approved indication included in the local product label. Results: Baseline data are available for 30,138 patients of whom 22,717 had nAMD; 4,710 had DME; 2,414 had RVO (branch RVO [BRVO]/central RVO [CRVO]; 1,366/1,048) and 297 had mCNV. At baseline, the mean age of patients with nAMD/DME/BRVO/ CRVO/mCNV was 77.4/64.1/69.4/69.7/58.4 years, respectively. The mean baseline best‐corrected visual acuity for treatment‐naive patients with nAMD/DME/BRVO/CRVO/mCNV was 49.7/56.3/52.0/40.6/50.8 letters, respectively; while that for patients previously treated with ranibizumab was 56.5/59.3/58.7/49.5/58.0 letters, respectively. The following co‐morbidity variations were found at baseline across all five sub‐groups; hypertension (35.3‐68.1%), diabetes (9.8‐99.5%), hypercholesterolemia (20.5‐45.4%), and myocardial infarction (3.4‐8.3%). Conclusions: LUMINOUS, the largest ever study in medical retina, included patients from routine clinical practice with more diverse demographics, ocular baseline characteristics, and comorbidities than reported in previous randomised controlled trials. These real‐world data will aid physicians in optimising patient outcomes with ranibizumab treatment across all approved indications.

DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdw365.15
AB: Background: One of the most effective chemotherapies for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is nab‐paclitaxel (nab‐P) which is approved for the treatment of MBC after failure of 1st‐line therapy and when anthracyclines are not indicated. Randomized clinical trials have shown high efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Real world data of nab‐P in MBC, however, are still limited. Methods: The prospective multicenter non‐interventional study NABUCCO was designed to collect data on the routine treatment of 700 patients ( pts) with MBC in approximately 100 sites across Germany. Primary objective was the time to tumor progression (TTP), secondary objectives were overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), the dosage scheme of nab‐P, time on treatment, safety parameters and quality of life. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. TTP and OS were calculated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Results: Between 4/2012 and 4/2015 705 pts with MBC at 128 sites had been enrolled. 697 pts were evaluable with a median follow‐up of 17.7 months. Baseline characteristics: Median age 62.3 years (range 29.2‐89.3), age > 65 years n = 291 (41.8%), ECOG PS > 2 n = 49 (7.0%), prior taxanes 419 pts (60.1%). Pts were treated at the physician's discretion. The application mode of nab‐P was as follows: 260 mg/m2 q3w (n = 153, 22.0%), > 15% reduced dose q3w (n = 37, 5.3%), 150 mg/m2 d1, d8, d15 q4w (n = 54, 7.7%), > 15% reduced dose d1, d8, d15 q4w (n = 219, 31.4%), 100‐125 mg/m2 d1,8,15 q3w (n = 90, 12.9%) and other (n = 144, 20.7%). Table: 236P Summary of effectiveness analyses by treatment line 34.3% of pts developed adverse events grade 3/4 which included leukopenia (7.9%) and infections (4.2%). Peripheral sensory neuropathy grade 1/2 was reported for 35.0% of pts and grade 3 for 4.3% of pts, respectively. Further subgroup analyses will be presented. Conclusions: The results of the NABUCCO study confirm the clinical trial outcomes and the favorable benefit‐risk profile of nab‐P in pts with MBC in a real‐life setting. (Table Presented).

AB: Background: Despite the increasing role of cryoballoon ablation (CBA) in the treatment of atrial fibrillation only few real‐world data are available on standard clinical cryoablation practice. In a prospective 2:1 randomized study we examined two different ablation strategies: CBA controlled by 1.) assessment of the degree of balloon occlusion at the PV entrance using radiopaque contrast agent injection and additional PVelectrogram recording versus 2.) PV‐electrogram recording only. Methods: 69 patients with paroxysmal (PAF) or persistent (PERAF) Afib underwent CBA with the Arctic Front Advanced ablation system (AFA) with an integrated circular mapping catheter (CMC). In 43 patients (Group 1) the CMC were positioned under fluoroscopy in the target vein. The AFA inflated and a cryoablation therapy were started only after antral PV occlusion of degree 3 or 4 controlled by radiopaque contrast agent injection, than real time PV electrogram recording was used to monitor or assess the PV isolation. In 26 patients (Group 2) the use of contrast fluid was allowed only in line with the transseptal puncture procedure. The therapeutic effectivity control based on real time PV electrogram recording only. Therapeutic‐settings: 180 seconds per cryoshot, after PV isolation a safety cryoshot was applied. Phrenicusstimulation was performed during treatment of the right PV's. The primary endpoints were complete PV isolation (PVI) at the end of the ablation procedure, and early Afib recurrence by assessing 3 month long‐term follow‐up data. Furthermore the study examined procedural variables during ablation for PVI. Results: In group 1 patients mean age was 64 ±18 years, 49% were male, 65% had persistent Afib; in the group 2 the mean age was 68±9 years, 46% were male, 62% had persistent Afib. The two modalities were comparable in efficiencies, including: acute PVI >88%, cryoenergy application (in minutes), time to isolation, temperature drop/nadir and procedural time (119.8±17.6 vs 117.7±22.5 min). However, when compared to group 1, the cryoballoon procedure in group 2 demonstrated a 26% reduction in the dose area product (2528 vs 3419 Gcm2) but significant more cryoapplications to isolate the left superior pulmonary vein (3.3 vs 2.5 cryoshots; p<0.05). Additionally, the complication rate (15% and 9%) was comparable and also the 3 month follow up results: 90% SR for PERAF and 100% for PAF in both groups. Conclusion: CBA without fluoroscopic control of balloon occlusion of the PVentrance using contrast fluid can reduce radiation exposure without prolonging procedure times or affecting the outcome.

AB: REVEAL is the first large, prospective observational study aimed at examining the contemporary demographics, burden of disease, clinical management, patient‐reported outcomes, and health care resource utilization in patients with polycythemia vera in the United States. Background: Polycythemia vera (PV) has a prevalence of 44 to 57 per 100,000 people in the United States. Prospective data concerning the demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns of patients with PV in the United States are lacking. Patients and Methods: The ongoing, prospective, observational REVEAL study evaluates demographics, disease burden, clinical management, patient‐reported outcomes, and health care resource utilization of adult patients with PV in the United States. This report summarizes the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients at enrollment (baseline). Results: Patients (n = 2510) were a median age of 67.0 years, 54.2% were male, and 89.1% were white. The median time from PV diagnosis to study enrollment was 4.0 (range, 0‐56.3) years. Most patients (89.7%) were diagnosed after an abnormal blood test. Less than half (49.2%) underwent JAK2 mutation analysis, of whom 95.8% were JAK2 V617F mutation positive; < 1% were positive for JAK2 exon 12 mutations. At enrollment, 47.7% of patients had elevated hematocrit (> 45%), 35.8% had elevated platelets (> 400 x 109/L), and 37.0% had elevated leukocytes (> 10 x 109/L). Most patients (94.5%) were receiving active PV treatment, predominantly therapeutic phlebotomy alone (33.6%), hydroxyurea monotherapy (29.0%), or hydroxyurea plus phlebotomy (23.7%). Thrombotic events occurred in 11.9% of patients before PV diagnosis (venous, 6.7%; arterial, 5.7%), and 8.3% between diagnosis and enrollment. Hypertension (70.6%) was the most common previous medical condition. Conclusion: REVEAL enrollment data inform our understanding of the baseline demographics, diagnostic approach, disease characteristics, and treatment patterns of patients with PV in the United States. Longitudinal real‐world data collected in this study will complement information collected during randomized controlled clinical trials. Copyright © 2018 The Authors

AB: Background: Although pazopanib (PAZ) has been evaluated in clinical trials of patients (pts) with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), limited real‐world data on the effectiveness and safety of PAZ exist. The PRINCIPAL study (NCT01649778) assessed the effectiveness and safety of first‐line PAZ in a real‐world setting. Methods: In this nonrandomized, prospective study, pts with advanced and/or metastatic clear cell RCC were enrolled in PRINCIPAL within 30 days of initiating first‐line PAZ. Data on progression, survival, and safety were collected approximately every 3 months (mos) until death, consent withdrawal, or loss to follow‐up, for up to 30 mos. Pts in PRINCIPAL were separated into two groups based on key eligibility criteria from the Phase III COMPARZ trial (Motzer et al. NEJM. 2013;369:722). Key clinical trial eligible (CTE) criteria included no prior systemic therapy, presence of measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, Karnofsky performance status ≥70, adequate organ system function, no history or clinical evidence of central nervous system metastases, and no coronary or cerebral artery disease at baseline. CTE pts were compared to non‐CTE (NCTE) pts. Clinical effectiveness (ie, median overall survival [mOS], median progression‐free survival [mPFS], and overall response rate [ORR]), adverse event (AE) measures, and relative dose intensity (RDI) were assessed in both pt populations. Results: Of the 657 enrolled pts who received ≥1 dose of PAZ, 97 (14.8%) were CTE and 560 (85.2%) were NCTE. RDI ≥85% was achieved in 70.1% and 56.6% in the CTE and NCTE populations, respectively. Effectiveness was similar in the CTE and the NCTE populations (mPFS, 9.6 vs 10.7 mos; ORR, 33.0% vs 29.8%; mOS, 26.3 vs 32.9 mos). Serious AEs were reported by 23.7% of CTE and 28.2% of NCTE pts. AEs led to dose adjustment/interruption in 83.5% and 95.2%, respectively, and AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 8.2% of the CTE and 15.5% NCTE pts. Conclusions: The results of the PRINCIPAL study suggest that first‐line PAZ for pts with advanced or metastatic RCC remains effective and safe in a real‐world setting, showing similar outcomes to those reported in large randomized clinical trials.

AB: Background: Real world data on appropriateness of indication, adherence to guideline recommendations, and mode of selection for coronary revascularization in Europe are scarce. Purpose:We designed the APpropriAteness of percutaneous Coronary interventions in patients with ischemic HEart disease ‐ APACHE Pilot study to first explore the degree of appropriateness of indication of PCI, multi‐disciplinary decisionmaking processes, and implementation of key guideline recommendations in patients undergoing coronary revascularization in Italy. Methods: We analyzed data from twenty‐two Italian hospitals (20 patients/site), thirteen (59%) with on‐site cardiac surgery. 440 patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndrome were independently selected in a 4:1 ratio with half diabetics without site personnel involvement in the selection of the cases identified to minimize selection bias. Appropriateness of PCI indication was evaluated using validated appropriate use scores (AUS). An angiographic core laboratory verified site‐reported coronary anatomy and identified borderline coronary stenoses. In patients with stable CAD adherence to the following ESC recommendations was examined: a) % of patients with complex coronary anatomy (including lesions of the left main, proximal LAD and/or three‐vessel CAD) treated after heart‐team discussion; b) % of fractional flow reserve‐guided PCI for borderline stenoses in patients without documented ischemia; c) % of patients receiving guideline‐directed medical therapy at the time of PCI. Finally, pre‐test probability (PTP) of CAD in stable CAD patients without known coronary anatomy and its association with test of ischemia use was examined. The study is registered on ClinicalTrial.Gov ID: NCT02748603. Results: Of all PCIs, 35.2% were classified as appropriate, 43.4% as uncertain, and 12.5% as inappropriate. Median (25th, 75th) AUS was 6 (5,7). Median PTP of CAD in stable CAD patients was 69% (78% intermediate PTP, 22% high PTP, no patient with low PTP). The use of provocative tests of ischemia was similar (p=0.71) in patients with intermediate (n=140, 63%) and with high PTP (n=40, 66%). In patients with stable CAD (n=352) guideline adherence to the 3 recommendations explored was: a) 11%; b) 25%; c) 23%. AUS was higher in patients evaluated by the heart team as compared to patients who were not [7 (6,8) vs 5 (4,7); P=0.001] (Figure). Most hospitals (n=12, 54%) did not have either a heart‐team institutional protocol or regularly planned heart‐team meetings. (Figure Presented) Conclusions: Use of heart‐teams approaches and adherence to guideline recommendations on coronary revascularization in a real world setting is limited. This pilot study documents the feasibility of measuring appropriateness and guideline adherence in clinical practice and identifies substantial opportunities for quality improvement.

DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2018.36.15_suppl.e20527
AB: Background: Radical resection is preferred for treatment of patients with T1 lung cancer, and patient prognoses could be significantly affected by tumor pathological types. Since the clinical data of patients with T1 non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were rarely reported, the real‐world study was proposed to explore clinical characteristics and prognoses of the target population in practice. Methods: The study was conducted based on a national collaborative lung cancer database (designed by LinkDoc Technology Co, Ltd.). The pathologically diagnosed T1 NSCLC and SCLC patients who received surgeries from 2014 to 2017 were enrolled to evaluate overall survival (OS) in the total population and in the subgroups. The OS were measured by the Kaplan‐Meier method and the Logrank test. Results: A total of 12,703 subjects with T1 NSCLC and 251 subjects with SCLC subjects were enrolled in the study. The one, two, and three‐year OS rates of the NSCLC patients were 97.5%, 93.8%, and 89.0%, respectively while the OS rates of the SCLC patients were 90.5%, 77.6% and 72.1% individually. The patients with T1 SCLC presented significantly poorer OS than the NSCLC patients (hazard ratio, HR: 3.920, 95% confidential intervals, 95% CI, 2.723, 5.654, p < 0.05). In the subgroups of the patients categorized by age, gender, smoking/drinking history, body mass index (BMI), tumor size, modes of surgeries, poorer OS rate of the SCLC patients was observed compared to that of the NSCLC patients (p < 0.05). In the NSCLC subpopulation, OS in the elderly patients, patients with squamous cell carcinoma, patients with poor differentiated tumors, and patients with lymph metastases were poorer as demonstrated by multivariate analyses (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The real‐world data offered clinical evidences on management of Chinese T1 NSCLC and SCLC patients. Poorer patient surival was observed in the T1 SCLC patients compared to the NSLCLC patients that could be references for design and data interpretation of the randomized clinical trials.

AB: Background/Introduction: The efficacy of catheter‐based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) in terms of blood pressure (BP) reduction has been questioned, while "real‐world" data from registries are needed. In this study, we report the complete set of 12‐month data on office and ambulatory BP changes as well as the predictors for BP response to RDN from a national registry. Methods: In 4 Greek hospital centers, 79 patients with severe drug‐resistant hypertension (age 59 +/‐ 10 years, 53 males, body mass index 33 +/‐ 5 kg/m2; office BP and 24‐h ambulatory BP were 176 +/‐ 15/95 +/‐ 13 and 155 +/‐ 14/90 +/‐ 12 mmHg, respectively, 4.4 +/‐ 0.9 antihypertensive drugs) underwent RDN and were followed‐up for 12 months in the Greek Renal Denervation Registry. Bilateral RDN was performed using percutaneous femoral approach and standardized techniques. Results: Reduction in office systolic/diastolic BP at 6 and 12 months from baseline was ‐30/‐12 and ‐29/‐12 mmHg, while the reduction in 24‐h ambulatory BP was ‐16/‐9 and ‐15/‐9 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.05 for all). Patients that were RDN responders (85%, n = 58), defined as an at least 10‐mmHg decrease in office systolic BP at 12 months, compared to non‐responders were younger (57 +/‐ 9 vs 65 +/‐ 8 years, p < 0.05), had higher baseline office systolic BP (176 +/‐ 17 vs 160 +/‐ 11 mmHg, p < 0.05) and 24‐h systolic BP (159 +/‐ 13 vs 149 +/‐ 11 mmHg, p < 0.05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that age, obesity parameters, and baseline office BP were independent predictors of RDN response (p < 0.05 for both), but not the type of RDN catheter or the use of aldosterone antagonists. At 12 months, there were no significant changes in renal function and any new serious device or procedure‐related adverse events. Conclusions: In our "real‐world" multicenter national registry, the efficacy of renal denervation in reducing BP as well as safety is confirmed during a 12‐month follow‐up. Moreover, younger age, obesity, and higher levels of baseline systolic BP are independently related to better BP response to RDN. Copyright © 2016 Springer‐Verlag Berlin Heidelberg

DOI: 10.1159/000365775
AB: Background: To date, one randomized, controlled, clinical trial (RCCT) demonstrated that GH‐treated patients with SHOX deficiency (SHOX‐D) had GH‐mediated height gain comparable to that of girls with Turner syndrome (TS). No new safety concerns were identified, but the study was limited by small sample size. Objective and hypotheses: To examine long‐term outcomes in patients treated in standard clinical practice, we assessed final height (FH) and safety outcomes in GH‐treated patients diagnosed with SHOX‐D using data collected in a multinational observational study (Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS)). Method: At time of analysis, 444 GH‐treated patients with SHOX‐D (59% girls), diagnosed by genetic analysis and/or investigator assessment, had baseline height available. FH (defined by one or more of the following: closed epiphyses, height velocity <2 cm/year, last bone age >14 years in girls/>16 years in boys) was available for 85 patients (72% girls). Results: Mean+/‐S.D. baseline age was 9.4+/‐3.1 years, and height SDS was‐2.4+/‐0.8. Initial GH dose was 0.30+/‐0.10 mg/kg per week, increasing at FH by<10%. FH at age of 15.5+/‐1.5 years and after 4.2+/‐2.3 years of GH treatment was ‐1.6+/‐1.1 SDS; height gain from baseline was 0.9+/‐1.0 SDS. Of 434 patients with SHOX‐D and R1 follow‐up visit (2.9+/‐1.8 years follow‐up), >1 adverse event was reported for 89 (21%) compared with 5214/18 929 (28%) for GeNeSIS overall and 710/1663 (43%) for TS. Adverse events reported for R1% of patients with SHOX‐D were precocious puberty (3%), arthralgia (3%), hypothyroidism (1%), back pain (1%), and headache (1%). One death was reported, but no cases of malignancy or diabetes. IGF1 SDS was ‐1.8+/‐2.7 at baseline, increased to 1.2+/‐1.8 at 3 years of follow‐up, and was >+2 S.D. for 26% of patients at >1 follow‐up visit. Conclusion: In conclusion, 'real‐world' data from a large cohort of GH‐treated patients with SHOX‐D support the RCCT findings, with significant height gain to FH and no additional safety concerns.

AB: Background and Aims: Second generation direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) improve hepatitis C (HCV) sustained viral response rates (SVR). Cost limits their use but benefits obtained in resource utilization should influence availability. Our hospital based outpatient HCV clinic in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada, serves northern Vancouver Island, a large, rural region (population 60,000) with recognized high HCV prevalence. Resources include two nurses, one clerical support staff, and one physician. We track nursing and physician time per visit in minutes (mins/pt) to measure resource utilization. We can compare two equal time periods assessing and treating Genotype 1 patients with the same resources. The period of first generation DAA access, telaprevir or bocepravir with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (January 1st 2012 to February 1st 2014, Triple therapy cohort), and the era of second generation DAA access, allowing interferon free therapy (July 1st 2014 to August 1st 2016, DAA cohort). Methods: A retrospective chart review of a computer based system recording nurse and physician time utilized per patient visit. We compare patient volumes assessed and physician and nurse resources used, summarized as mins/pt, to manage those patients who proceeded to therapy in each cohort, and with SVR results available by period completion. Results: For equal time periods with equal resources, we assessed and treated more patients in the DAA vs triple therapy cohorts (n = 216 vs. n = 131 nurse assessed; n = 147 vs. n = 90 physician assessed; n = 74 vs. n = 16 treatment starts), representing an increased percentage of physician assessed pts proceeding to treatment (50.3% vs. 20%) and increase in the absolute number of SVRs (results available for the respective cohorts n = 50/54 vs. n = 9/10). The percent of SVRs per cohort was not different, 92.6% vs. 92%, reflecting a more restrictive patient selection in the triple therapy cohort. Nurse and physician times required per patient were decreased in the DAA cohort (nurse time/pt = 300 mins vs. 1501 mins) and physician time/pt = 50 mins vs. 88 mins). Conclusions: We have presented real world data from a rural HCV clinic. It shows a decrease in physician and nurse resource utilization per treated patient, allowing an increase in the percentage of patients treated and the absolute number SVR's achieved. This reflects improved clinical resource utilization with DAA's, thus treating more patients with the same clinical resources, aiding the goal of eradicating HCV outside of major centers.

AB: Background and Aims: Sofosbuvir (SOF), a direct‐acting antiviral agent used to treat chronic Hepatitis C infection, has been the backbone for treatment of all HCV genotypes since its approval by the FDA in Dec 2013. SOF forms inactive metabolite GS‐331007, which is eliminated in the urine. Subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30) accumulate GS‐331007 in their blood, therefore SOF should not be used in this patient population per the FDA approved prescription information. Clinical trials have shown that no renal side effects are observed when following recommended therapy regimens, but there is limited real world data in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction (eGFR < 60). This is a retrospective assessment of SOF's effect on renal function in such patients with chronic HCV in Hawaii. Methods: Data were collected from EMR at the Queen's Liver Center and Pharmacare. All patients with eGFR data at Baseline, End of Treatment (EOT) and 12 weeks post therapy were included in the analyses. A paired T‐test was used to determine changes in patients' serum creatinine (SCr) levels from Baseline to EOTand from EOT to 12 weeks post therapy. A Friedman testwas used to detect differences in GFR values between groups stratified by baseline GFR at Baseline, EOT, and 12 weeks post therapy. Results: Our population (n = 221) consisted of 143 males, 78 females, 76 patients aged 65 and above, and 14 patients with baseline renal impairment (GFR < 60). Baseline GFR values were as follows: 207 in the >60 group,10 in the 50‐59, 3 in the 40‐49, 0 in the 30‐39, and 1 in the 20‐29. There was an average increase in SCr of 0.04 from baseline to EOT (t(220) = 5.27, p < 0.01). No significant difference was found for SCr between EOT and 12 weeks post therapy (t(220) = 1.12, p = 0.26). In the over 65 years of age subgroup, an average increase in SCr of 0.05 was found during therapy, and no significant difference was found between EOT and 12 weeks post therapy (t(75) = 4.03, p < 0.01; t(75) = 0.76, p = 0.45). No significant differences were found for patients with baseline renal impairment (t(13) = 0.96, p = 0.34; t(13) = 0.51, p = 0.61). There was no significant difference between Baseline, EOT, and 12 weeks post therapy GFR values of the stratified GFR groups. Conclusions: The vast majority of patients had GFR > 60 throughout therapy, and no differences were found in patients over 65 and those with baseline renal impairment, suggesting that Sofosbuvir does not adversely affect renal function. These observations need to be confirmed in a larger cohort study.

AB: Introduction: NVAF is estimated to affect between 6.4 and 7.4 million Americans in 2018, and increases the risk of stroke five‐fold. To mitigate this risk, guidelines recommend anticoagulating AF patients unless their stroke risk is very low. Despite these recommendations, 30‐60% of NVAF patients don't receive indicated anticoagulation. To better understand why this may be, we surveyed PCPs and cardiologists nationwide on their attitudes, knowledge and practices toward managing NVAF with warfarin and direct‐acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Methods: We surveyed 1,000 PCPs and 500 cardiologists selected randomly from a master list of the American Medical Association, using a paper based, anonymous, self‐administered, mailed scannable survey. The survey contained questions on key demographics and data concerning attitudes, knowledge and practices related to prescribing DOACs. The surveys went out in the fall/winter of 2017‐8 with a $10 incentive gift card. Survey responses were scanned into an Excel database and analyzed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC) for descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Two hundred and forty‐nine providers (167 PCPs, 82 cardiologists) participated in the study with a response rate of 18.8% (249/1320). Respondent mean years +/‐SD of experience since completing residency was 23.2 +/‐ 13.8. Relative to cardiologists, less PCPs use CHADsVASC (36.8% vs. 74.4%) (p<0.0001); more have never used HAS‐BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, or ATRIA (38.5% vs. 9.8%) (p<.0001); more felt that their lack of knowledge/experience with DOACs was a barrier to prescribing the agents (p=0.005); and more reported that they could use additional education on DOACs (87% vs. 47%) (p<0.0001). Overall, cardiologists were more worried about ischemic stroke outcomes, while PCPs were more concerned with GI bleeding. Cardiologists also felt that clinical trial data were most helpful in choosing the most appropriate DOAC for their patients, while PCPs felt that Real World Data was most useful. Conclusions: Cardiologists were more concerned with ischemic stroke while anticoagulating patients and utilized screening instruments like CHADsVASC in a majority of their patients. PCPs were concerned with GI bleeds when anticoagulating but nearly 40% utilized no screening tools to assess bleeding risk. Our findings show that future education about DOACs would be warranted especially with PCPs.

AB: Introduction: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) accounts for 10‐ 20% of all JIA patients. It is characterized by findings of systemic inflammation such as fever, rash, serositis, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, and arthritis. Arthritis may develop later in life with variable clinical features. Macrophage activation syndrome is the most life threatening complication. Progress in the understanding of pathogenesis has led to the development of cytokine‐targeted therapies, biologics. Objective(s): This study aims to evaluate the treatment options in SJIA, particularly effect of methotrexate prior to biologics. Method(s): A retrospective review of 52 cases of systemic JIA in the last 20 years was performed. Result(s): Thirty one (59.6%) of the patients were female. The mean age of diagnosis was 89.8 +/‐ 7.88 months and the mean follow‐up was 32 +/‐ 18.5 months. Twenty seven (51.9%) had monocyclic, 9 (17.3%) had polycyclic and 16 (30.8%) had polyarticular course. All of the patients had intermittant fever at onset, followed by rash and arthritis, and the least common symptom was serous involvement. Ten (19.2%) cases had macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Four of them presented with MAS as the initial diagnosis. The laboratory values of MAS cases were significantly lower in ESR, platelet and fibrinogen levels and higher in ferritin and triglyceride levels when compared with other cases. Eight of the MAS cases (80%) had monocyclic, 1 (10%) had polycyclic and 1 had polyarticular course. In 8 of the MAS cases (80%) the disease was controlled by pulse steroid followed by methotrexate alone. Fifty (96.2%) cases received pulse steroids. Methotrexate (MTX) treatment was added in 47 (88.5%) cases. Thirty two (61.5%) cases were in remission with methotrexate treatment, whereas 14 (27%) cases required an additional biological agent. Majority of patients with biologics (56.3%) had polyarticular course. Adalimumab (1), anakinra (3), tocilizumab (6), etanercept (8) and canakinumab (9) were the biologics. In 4 cases, cyclosporin was added to control the disease. Eight patients (15.4%) were transferred to adult rheumatology clinic for persisting arthritis. Two (4.3%) of the patients died due to sepsis and MAS, respectively. Seventeen (32.7%) were in remission under medication, and 25 (48.1%) were in remission without medication. Conclusion(s): Randomized controlled trials have evidence about effectiveness of biologics, particularly IL‐1 and IL‐6 inhibitors, in treatment of SJIA. However, this study shows that methotrexate could control the disease in about two thirds of patients, particularly in "monocyclic" SJIA. Biologics such as anakinra, canakinumab, or tocilizumab could be preferred in cases with systemic onset and polyarticular course. Multicentered studies with more patients are needed to support this "real‐world data".

AB: Background: Dolutegravir (DTG) arrived on the crest of a wave of excellent efficacy, safety and tolerability data. Real world antiretroviral (ARV) experience can differ significantly from phase II/III studies. We review our experience with DTG since its inception. Methods: All patients prescribed DTG prior to 31/10/15 were identified via pharmacy records. Demographic, clinical, virological and biochemical data were collated at baseline and follow up appointments. Results: 178 patients (10.1% of our cohort) received DTG, providing 97.5 patient years of follow up. 94 (52.8%) were White British and 53 (29.8%) Black African; 132 (74.1%) were male of whom 106 (80.3%) were MSM. There were 3 (1.7%) patients co‐infected with Hepatitis B and 10 (5.6%) with Hepatitis C. Median nadir CD4 count was 250 cells/mm3 with median CD4 at diagnosis 365 c/mm3. DTG was used antenatally in 8 patients without any adverse outcomes. 130 (73.0%) were ART‐experienced and 48 (27.0%) naive. At DTG initiation ART‐naive patients had a median CD4 count of 369 c/mm3 and VL 41,499 copies/mL. ART‐experienced patients had a median CD4 count of 527 c/mm3 and VL<40 c/mL. 98 (55.1%) patients received DTG as Triumeq (DTG, abacavir, lamivudine), 77 (43.3%) as DTG with other concomitant agents, and 3 (1.7%) received both DTG and Triumeq. The most prevalent backbone with DTG was Truvada (39/77, 50.6%). Median duration of DTG use was 194 days (range 2‐608). Median VL remained <40 c/mL with no significant change in liver function or lipids. The expected creatinine rise seen in DTG licensing studies occurred at the 4 week point, then plateaued: 26 (14.6%) patients discontinued DTG: 15 (8.4%) due to side effects, 5 (2.8%) were lost to follow up, 2 (1.1%) died. Median time to discontinuation was 91 days (range 2‐253). Side effects were reported by 41 (23.0%) patients with gastrointestinal (33.9%) and CNS (32.1%) disturbance most common. Two virological failures occurred in patients taking Triumeq, both failing with Raltegravir associated mutations (T97AT, E157Q). Conclusion: DTG has been safe and efficacious in our cohort in a wide variety of patients; however there were a large number of ARV‐induced side effects and resultant treatment switches. More real world data is required on DTG use to assess this further. (Table presented).

AB: BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) affects between 37 and 238 people per 100,000 in the United States. Golimumab (GLM), an anti‐TNF therapy, was recently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC. Increasing concerns about the budgetary impact of biologic therapies has intensified the need to understand the cost implications of their use. The primary objective of this study was to assess the cost per unit of effectiveness and number needed to treat (NNT) of patients receiving maintenance therapy of GLM after achieving clinical response during an induction period. METHODS: A cost effectiveness model was developed using the results of the PURSUIT‐Maintenance (PURSUIT‐M) study, a 54 week Phase 3 randomized, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind maintenance study of the safety and efficacy of GLM among individuals who had not used biologic therapy previously. This analysis evaluated the placebo‐adjusted cost per clinical response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing. Clinical response was measured as sustained clinical response through week 54. Clinical remission was measured at week 30 and week 54. Patients had to be in clinical remission at both time periods. Mucosal healing was measured at the same time points and manner as clinical remission. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for each of these endpoints. The PURSUIT‐M study included a GLM 100 mg and GLM 50 mg treatment arms. However, the 50 mg treatment arm was excluded since it is not the FDA‐approved labeled dose. Medication costs were calculated by applying the July, 2013 wholesale acquisition costs based on the FDA‐labeled dosing requirements. RESULTS: The cost per clinical response and NNT for clinical response of GLM was $184,690 and 6, respectively. The cost per remission and the NNT for patients in remission was $268,640, and 8, respectively. The cost per mucosal healing and NNT of mucosal healing was $213,617 and 7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis revealed that the cost effectiveness of GLM for the maintenance therapy of UC ranged from $184,690 for clinical response to $268,640 for clinical remission. The NNT ranged from 6 to 8 for the endpoints studied. Further studies using real‐world data may provide a better understanding of the cost effectiveness of anti‐TNF therapies and allow comparisons among different medications.

AB: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a complication of end stage liver diseasewith high morbidity and mortality, in which recent trial data suggests thatterlipressin may significantly improve outcomes. We performed a retrospectivecohort study of HRS outcomes with terlipressin use at a singletertiary hospital to provide real world data.Methods Patient episodes were obtained via a hospital pharmacy dispensingdatabase search for terlipressin used between May 2008 and May2011. Only episodes for which the indication was HRS (based onInternational Ascites Club definition, Gut 2007) and where there was sufficient follow‐up at this hospital were analysed. Rates were calculated per patient episode. The primary outcomes were treatment success (defined asdecrease in serum creatinine <133 umol/L or baseline, sustained over48 hours), HRS reversal (creatinine < 133 umol/L on any occasion) andthree month survival.Results Twenty‐seven episodes of terlipressin use were found. Patientswith variceal bleeding, irretrievable records or transferred to another hospital(1 patient for liver transplantation) were excluded. Twenty episodesmet inclusion criteria (18 patients, 13 male, 5 female, mean age 58). Twopatients each had two episodes. Patients had severe end stage liver diseasewith a mean CTP score of 11 and mean MELD score of 30. The underlyingaetiology for liver disease was alcohol alone in 13 cases, alcohol andhepatitis C in 4, hepatitis C alone in 1, diabetes/NAFLD in 1 and acutefulminant failure with paracetamol toxicity and alcohol in 1. None of thestudied patients were transplant candidates. Fluid resuscitation was givenfor a mean of 1.45 days before HRS was diagnosed and treatment commenced.A mean of 20 mg (range 4‐70 mg) or 5 (range 1‐17) days ofterlipressin was used per episode of HRS. Treatment success was achievedin 65% (13/20) whereas HRS reversal occurred in 75% (15/20). The threemonth survival rate was 15% (3/20) with a mean of 19 days survival inthose who died.Conclusion Despite the heterogeneity of patients in real‐world clinicalhospital practice, terlipressin achieved similar renal improvement in HRSas it did in the randomised controlled trials. Similarly however, survivalwas poor suggesting a need for careful selection of patients suitable fortherapy.

AB: Background: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended for thromboembolic events prevention in patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Two dose regimens are approved for dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban (direct oral anticoagulants‐DOACs) with specific dose reduction indications; however, there are few real‐world data comparisons between low‐dose DOAC regimen and warfarin. Purpose: To compare 1‐year safety and efficacy outcomes in patients treated with low‐dose regimen of DOACs or warfarin in everyday clinical practice. Methods: This cohort study enrolled all‐comer patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation that started either appropriate dose reduction of dabigatran (220 mg die), apixaban (5 mg die) and rivaroxaban (15 mg die), between January 2012 and December 2015 or warfarin with time period limited to November 2014 and December 2015. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years and inadequate time in therapeutic range (<60%) for patients treated with warfarin. Two data cleaning operators, Fuzzy Lookup and Fuzzy Grouping (Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Integration Services), were utilized for a match search data into the overall hospital database. Follow up events were censored at 1‐year. Results: This study included 570 patients: 148 (25%) were treated with dabigatran, 98 (17%) with apixaban, 28 (4%) with rivaroxaban and 296 (51%) with warfarin. Compared to warfarin patients, those on low‐dose DOACs regimen were older (77+/‐11 vs 72+/‐10 years, p=0.001), with lower creatinine clearance (calculated using the Cockcroft‐Gault formula, 62.2+/‐26.7 vs 72.1+/‐30.7 ml/min, p=0.02) and at higher bleeding and thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2‐VASc score 4.3+/‐1.5 vs 3.4+/‐1.7 and HAS‐BLED score 2.4+/‐1.1 vs 2.1+/‐0.9, p=0.001, for both). Among DOAC subgroups, patients on rivaroxaban had more severe renal impairment compared to patients on dabigatran and apixaban (p=0.001 and p=0.03, respectively) and also higher thromboembolic risk compared to patients on dabigatran (p=0.004). At 1‐year follow‐up, the overall bleeding and major‐bleeding rates in low‐dose DOAC patients were 12.8% and 2.5%, with no statistical difference compared to the warfarin subgroup. No fatal bleedings were reported. The rate of allcause death and thromboembolic events were 5.1% and 2.6% in DOAC group, with no statistical difference compared to the warfarin group. A trend toward a lower rate of treatment interruption was reported in DOAC patients compared to warfarin (14.8% vs 22.2%, p=0.07). Conclusions: Low‐dose DOAC regimen in high risk all‐comer patients showed comparable outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety compared to warfarin.

AB: BACKGROUND: Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced heart failure hospitalization and mortality in PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of Angiotensin Receptor‐Neprilysin Inhibitor With an Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitor to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure). However, real‐world data from its use are lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively assessed all baseline and follow‐up data of consecutive heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction receiving therapy with sacubitril/valsartan for Class I recommendation between December 2016 and July 2017. Baseline characteristics and dose titration of sacubitril/valsartan were compared between patients in clinical practice and in PARADIGM‐HF. A total of 120 patients (81% male) were switched from angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to sacubitril/valsartan. A total of 20.1% of patients received dose uptitration. Patients were treated with an equipotential dose of renin‐angiotensin system blockers before and after uptitration of sacubitril/valsartan (57 ± 29% vs. 53 ± 29% of target dose indicated by European Society of Cardiology guidelines; P = 0.286). However, they received a lower dose of sacubitril/valsartan in comparison with those in the PARADIGM‐HF (219 ± 12 vs. 375 ± 75 mg; P < 0.001). In comparison with the patients receiving sacubitril/valsartan in PARADIGM‐HF, patients in clinical practice were older and had a higher serum creatinine, higher New York Heart Association functional classification, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (all P‐value <0.05). Even in comparison with patients who experienced dropout during the run‐in phase of PARADIGM‐HF, real‐world patients exhibited baseline characteristics indicative of more disease severity. Patients were at high absolute baseline risk for adverse outcome as illustrated by the EMPHASIS‐HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) risk score of 6 (inter‐quartile range 3), in comparison with 5 (inter‐quartile range 4) in PARADIGM‐HF. After initiation of sacubitril/valsartan, New York Heart Association class significantly improved (P < 0.001), but systolic blood pressure dropped more than was reported in PARADIGM‐HF (7.1 ± 8.0 vs. 3.2 ± 0.4 mmHg; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in clinical practice exhibit baseline characteristics associated with more severe disease, which might lead to prescription of lower doses. Nevertheless, patients in clinical practice are at high risk of adverse outcome as illustrated by the EMPHASIS‐HF risk score, underscoring the large potential for sacubitril/valsartan therapy to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and all‐cause mortality.

AB: Introduction: FLT3 is a frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with two main types of mutations: internal tandem duplication (ITD) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). FLT‐mut AML is associated with poor prognosis. With the development of new therapies in AML, especially those targeting FLT3‐mut, there is a need to understand the current treatment (tx) patterns and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) among AML patients. The current study used real‐world data from medical records to evaluate tx patterns and HRU among adult AML patients. Methods: Hematologists and oncologists were recruited from 10 countries (US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Japan, and South Korea) from an established physician panel. Eligible patients were randomly selected by physicians and were categorized into 6 cohorts: 1) newly diagnosed (ND) FLT3‐mut patients <65, 2) ND FLT3‐mut patients ≥65, 3) ND FLT3‐wild type (FLT3‐wt) patients <65, 4) ND FLT3‐wt patients ≥65, 5) relapsed/refractory (R/R) FLT3‐mut patients, and 6) R/R FLT3‐wt patients. The index date was defined as the date of initiation of first AML therapy for ND patients, and the date of R/R classification for R/R patients. FLT3‐mut was based on the genetic test closest to the index date. FLT3‐mut and FLT3‐wt patients may harbor mutations in other genes. Baseline characteristics, tx patterns, and AML‐related HRU were collected and described for each cohort. Results: The study included 1,027 AML patients‐183 FLT3‐mut and 186 FLT3‐wt ND patients <65, 136 and 159 ND patients ≥65, and 181 and 182 R/R patients. Mean age was 48.2 and 72.3 for ND patients <65 and ≥65; among R/R patients, mean age of FLT3‐mut patients was younger than FLT3‐wt patients (53.2 vs. 56.8). Among FLT3‐mut patients, 70.0% had ITD and 42.4% had TKD mutations. The study identified substantial heterogeneity in tx pattern for AML. Among ND patients <65, the most common initial tx was standard‐to‐intermediate dose cytarabine (SDAC)‐based therapies (43.2 and 55.9% for FLT3‐mut and FLT3‐wt), followed by hypomethylating agent (HMA)‐based therapies (13.7 and 11.8%). Among ND patients ≥65, the most common initial tx were HMA‐based therapies (36.0 and 47.2%), followed by SDAC‐based therapies (30.1 and 30.8%). Among R/R patients, the most common initial tx after R/R was BSC only (39.8 and 24.7%), followed by SDAC‐based therapies (12.7 and 19.2%), HMA‐based therapies (9.4 and 16.5%), and low dose cytarabine‐based therapies (9.4 and 15.4%). About 20‐60% ND patients and 40% R/R patients received non‐guideline recommended tx. Among ND patients, tx for FLT3‐mut patients tended to be more aggressive than for FLT3‐wt patients. For patients <65, FLT3‐mut patients used more high‐dose cytarabine‐based therapies than FLT3‐wt patients (13.7 vs 9.7%); for patients ≥65, fewer FLT3‐mut patients used HMA‐based therapies than FLT3‐wt patients (36.0 vs 47.2%). The proportion of patients who received stem cell transplant was higher in FLT3‐mut vs. FLT3‐wt patients (ND<65: 29.2 vs. 24.3%; ND≥65: 13.6 vs. 8.5%; R/R: 23.6 vs. 18.1%). In addition, this study demonstrated that AML patients had extensive HRU. The average rate of hospitalization across all cohorts during the event‐free period (i.e., the period free of R/R for ND cohorts or before next R/R for R/R cohorts) was 0.27 hosp/mo (5.4 d/mo), while the rate during the post‐event period was 0.52 hosp/mo (6.5 d/mo). The average number of days of intensive care unit stays was 0.28 d/mo for the event‐free period and 0.50 d/mo for the post‐event period. For emergency department visits, the average rate was 0.23 visits/mo during the event‐free period and 0.54 visits/mo during the post‐event period. During both event‐free and post‐event periods, patients across all cohorts also experienced frequent outpatient visits, blood transfusions, and received extensive tx for infections. Conclusions: Using real‐world data of AML patients in multiple countries, this study reveals a considerable amount of heterogeneity of tx pattern, including many tx not consistent with tx guidelines. FLT3‐mut patients tended to receive more aggressive tx, consistent with fact that the mutation confers a poor prognosis. It also demonstrates extensive HRU among these patients, particularly among R/R cohorts. The study provides timely evidence to understand the current tx landscape and to highlight the substantial unmet needs among AML patients.

AB: Background: Anti‐citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are highly specific to RA and patients (pts) who are ACPA positive (+) tend to develop more severe, erosive disease than ACPA‐negative pts.1 In an observational study exploring the status of ACPA on RA treatment response to abatacept (ABA) or a TNF inhibitor (TNFi), mean (SE) changes from baseline in CDAI at 6 months was ‐8.8 for ABA and ‐5.6 for TNFi initiators.2 Objectives: To evaluate the costs and benefits of treating pts with RA who are ACPA+ with ABA vs TNFi on background MTX. Methods: An economic analysis was carried out estimating lifetime direct costs and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) of ACPA+ pts with RA treated with ABA or TNFi from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. QALYs are a measure of disease burden, adjusted to reflect quality of life lived. As data for the economic analysis were derived from a real‐world study, an "average" pt was modelled, whose baseline characteristics were based on the observational study. CDAI changes at 6 months for each treatment were converted to HAQ changes, and disease progression was based on HAQ score changes over a lifetime. Continuation of therapy was based on rates from the real‐world study. Mean long‐term survival on treatment with ABA or TNFi was derived from the literature.3 In the base case, pts discontinuing ABA or TNFi moved to palliative care (MTX). Direct medical costs and quality of life scores were correlated to HAQ scores.3,4 Costs included hospitalizations, joint replacements and treatment costs. Estimates of differences in costs and QALYs between ABA and TNFi initiators were used to calculate an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost per QALY gained). The annual cost of TNFi was calculated as an average of TNFi drugs in the UK ( 9113). For ABA, an average cost of five biologics was used ( 9244) to reflect a realistic cost to NHS UK. A sensitivity analysis examined the effect of varying the input parameters of efficacy, cost and utilities on costs and outcomes. Results: Based on an "average" pt from the observational study, the total estimated QALYs for ABA and TNFi initiators were 6.4 and 6.27, respectively. Total lifetime costs were 41,378 and 40,627, respectively. The lifetime cost for ABA initiators was higher than for TNFi initiators due to the higher proportion of pts continuing ABA after 6 months. ABA treatment resulted in lower hospitalization costs. The cost per QALY for ABA (vs TNFi) was 8667. An intervention with an ICER of less than 30,000 per QALY gained is generally considered to be cost effective in the UK. In a sensitivity analysis, in which the annual cost of TNFi was assumed to be the same as a biosimilar agent ( 7829), the ICER increased to 25,660. Conclusions: Based on real‐world data, abatacept is a cost‐effective alternative to TNFi in an ACPA+ pt with RA. The increased treatment costs of abatacept are offset by the gain in benefits (QALYs) from higher CDAI reductions with abatacept.

AB: Background: There is a paucity of real world data on current treatment patterns and outcomes in German advanced melanoma (MEL) patients (pts) after treatment with ipilimumab (IPI), an anti‐CTLA‐4 antibody since initial IPI approval in 2011. Methods: Retrospective multi‐country multi‐center observational study (n = 362) in adult patients ECOG performance status (PS) 0‐2 with unresectable stage III/IV MEL according to AJCC (2009); who had received at least one dose of IPI, with a minimum of 40 weeks (w) elapsed follow up since first IPI dose. Patients who had received at least two IPI doses and documented disease progression (progr.) within 24 w of last IPI dose (judged by the treating physician) were defined as IPI‐refractory (IPIr) (n = 226). This explorative data analysis describes the treatment patterns and overall survival (OS) among German IPIr patients. Results: 96 IPIr patients were identified. Mean age was 63 (standard deviation [SD] 14) years, 62 patients (65 %) were male and ECOG PS was 0/1 in 94 patients (98 %). Of the 87 (91 %) tested, 57 patients (66 %) were BRAF‐V600‐wildtype. IPI was initially received second line in 68/96 patients (71 %), and thirdline or later in 19/96 patients (20 %). Before first IPI dose, vemurafenib, and MTIC‐based therapies (dacarbazine, temozolamide) were the most common regimens. Patients received 3.6 (mean; SD 0.9) IPI doses; with 15 (16 %) receiving 2, 80 (83 %) 3 or 4, and 1 (1 %) >= 5 doses. A partial response as per treating physician's judgement was noted in 9/96 patients (9.4 %) with a median duration of response (from best response to IPI to progr.) of 8.1 w. Progressive disease was confirmed by physicians (by imaging) in 68/96 patients (71 %; median time to progr. [start of IPI to progr.] 10.0 w; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 7.7; 11.7). Individualized treatment after IPI was received by 45 patients (47 %): 26/45 patients received chemotherapy, 12/45 patients BRAFi, and 7/45 patients both. Combination carboplatin + paclitaxel (n = 12), MTIC‐based monotherapy (n = 9), and fotemustine (n = 9) were the most common post‐IPI chemotherapy regimens in German IPIr patients. For the German IPIr population (n = 96/226), median overall survival from progr. date (Kaplan‐Meier) as per treating physicians' judgment was 36.3 w (95 % CI 26.9; 46.9) in 45/96 IPIr patients receiving anti‐MEL treatment post‐IPI vs. 13.3 w (95 % CI 8.7; 24.6) in 51/96 IPIr patients without anti‐MEL treatment. Discussion: The data helps to understand current treatment patterns and physician‐reported survival in German patients with advanced MEL. IPI was mainly used 2nd or later line. Various therapies were used post‐IPI, and median survival was better in IPIr patients receiving anti‐MEL treatment post‐IPI.

AB: Background: In a Phase III randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of cytomegalovirus (CMV)‐seropositive Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) recipients, letermovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection through 24 weeks post‐ HCT. This research describes the impact of letermovir prophylaxis on the rate of rehospitalization in the clinical trial. Aims: The aim of this research is to describe the impact of letermovir prophylaxis on the rate of rehospitalization in the clinical trial. Methods: Rehospitalization was recorded as an exploratory endpoint in the clinical trial at end of treatment (Week 14), time of primary endpoint (Week 24) and through an extended follow‐up period (Week 48). The trial further recorded whether the rehospitalization was related to CMV (referred to as CMV‐related rehospitalization). Prespecified analyses describe the observed rates of rehospitalization for the letermovir and placebo groups at the specified times. Fine‐Gray cumulative incidence function (CIF) regression models were used to explore the rate of all‐cause, and CMV‐related rehospitalization accounting for the competing risk of mortality. A multiple linear regression model was used to describe the cumulative length of stay (LOS) for all‐cause rehospitalizations that occurred through Week 48 (excluding time of initial transplant stay). Results: Observed rates of all‐cause rehospitalization were lower for the letermovir group compared to placebo at end of treatment (36.6% vs. 47.6%), time of primary endpoint (48.6% vs. 55.3%), and through extended follow‐up (55.7% vs. 60.6%). The CIF regression model demonstrated rates of all‐cause rehospitalization were significantly lower through Week 14 (HR=0.72; p=0.021) but did not reach significance at Week 24 (HR=0.81; p=0.109) or Week 48 (HR=0.84; p=0.173); and CMV‐related rehospitalizations were significantly reduced at Week 14 (0.6% vs. 7.1%; HR=0.09; p=0.001), Week 24 (2.8% vs. 7.6%; HR= 0.36; p=0.015), and Week 48 (3.1% vs. 8.8%; HR=0.34; p=0.007). The adjusted mean cumulative LOS was shorter for letermovir subjects compared to placebo subjects but did not reach statistical significance (3.1 fewer days p= 0.333). Summary/Conclusion: Letermovir was shown to significantly reduce the rate of clinically significant CMV infection in a placebo‐controlled randomized clinical trial. These analyses suggest that there is also a reduction in the rate and cumulative days of rehospitalization. Caution is warranted as the trial was not sufficiently powered to detect differences in this exploratory endpoint. Nonetheless, these data provide valuable insights into the economic burden of CMV. Real world data and findings from future clinical trials are needed to better understand the nature of the association between CMV and rehospitalizations.

DOI: 10.1024/0301-1526/a000570
AB: Introduction: New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed as alternatives to warfarin, the standard oral anticoagulation therapy for patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) or recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). NOACs do offer advantages over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), including faster onset, shorter half‐lives, fewer drug interactions and no need for routine monitoring. Despite the use of NOACs is increasing in the real world, there are still few real‐world data based on the clinical use of new oral anticoagulant drugs. In this observational study we retrospectively report on patients who switched from VKAs to NOACs between November 2013 and January 2016 at a single thrombosis Centre. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed upon data from 39 patients switched to NOACs out of 800 patients administered with VKAs at our thrombosis Centre (the FCSA's 223rd Centre). Between November 2013 and January 2015 all patients underwent clinical assessment, recording also CHA2DS2VASc and HAS BLED scores, last 6 months Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR) and Creatinine Clearance. Patients were accepted for NOACs according to the guidelines of our province‐local health authority Steering Committee and Investigators. Elegibility criteria were: TTR less than 70%, difficulty to adjust AVK doses, patient's impossibility to carry out INR checks and patient's preference. Follow‐up visits were scheduled at 3, 6 and 12 months after switching to NOACs. Results: Most of switched patient were originally warfarinazed (94.87%) due to NVAF in the 66.66% of cases. NOACs patients median age was 74 years and the 43.59% were older than 75 years. M/F ratio was 1.3. Mean CHA2DS2VASc risk of stroke was 4 and mean HAS BLED bleeding score was 3. TTR less than 70% was the first reason to switch to NOACs (48.72% of cases), while difficulty to adjust AVK doses and patient's preference were equiparable (23.07% and 28.21%). Creatinine Clearance was less than 60 ml/min in 1/3 of patients (Figure 1). Rivaroxaban was the preferred NOAC drug prescribed (38.46%), followed by Apixaban (35.89%) and Dabigatran (25.64%).15.38% of patients was still on antiplatelet therapy. (Figure 2) No cardiovascular or bleeding events nor deaths were reported at follow‐up. Conclusion: Our study duplicated literature's major studies patients baseline characteristics. In particular, it was confirmed that age older than 65 years is related to a lower TTR, which is an acceptable reason to change AVKs with NOACs. Given the chance to switch from warfarin to NOACs, more than a half of patients in our group preferred new drugs as they can be administered in fixed doses without routine monitoring. New oral anticoagulants are more effective than warfarin for prevention of thromboembolism with a decreased risk for bleeding. In our experience they appeared to have a favorable safety profile, making them very promising alternatives to warfarin.

AB: Introduction: ICD implantation carries a significant risk of both acute and long term complications, however there has been no contemporary systematic review of this data. We present a metaanalysis (MA) of de novo ICD implant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the rates and trends of complications and review these findings in the context of recently published data from a large ICD registry. Methods: PubMed was searched for any RCTs involving ICD implantation. Of 182 articles screened, 18 were identified for analysis including 6433 patients with a range of mean follow‐up 3 months‐5.6 years. Exclusion criteria were studies of children, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, resynchronisation therapy and box changes. We also searched for ICD registry data and compared 'real‐world' data on ICD complications to that collated from RCTs. Results: The combined total complication rate from the 18 included studies (excluding INappropriate shocks) was 9% (95% CI 6.4‐12.4%). Range of publication dates was 1999‐2011. Mean age was 63.5 years, ejection fraction (EF) 30% and 79% were male. The classification and reporting of ICD complications, including temporal data, varied widely between studies. Where detailed information was available we categorised complications as access‐related (to include pneumothorax, haematoma and thrombosis) 2.8 % (95% CI 2.1‐3.8%); lead‐related (displacement, fracture, need for revision, perforation/tamponade, impedance/insulation anomalies) 6.3% (95% CI 3.8‐10.2%) and generator‐related (generator failure, migration, erosion or any need for revision) 3.0% (95% CI 1.7‐5.5%). The infection rate was 2.3% (95% CI 1.0‐5.2%). Independent predictors of complications were year of publication, mean follow‐up period and proportion of male patients. We also reviewed complication data from the most recent publication of the largest registry, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) ICD registry, which reported on 356515 initial ICD implantations between 2006 and 2010. The population was comparable to that of the RCTs with a mean age of 67.3 years, EF 27.9% and 72.7% male. The total major complication rate was 3.08%, the most common being lead displacement 1.02%, haematoma 0.86% and pneumothorax 0.44%. A comparison of the registry and MA data is shown in figure 1. Conclusion: The overall ICD complication rate in our meta‐analysis is 9% over 16 months. Predictors of complications were year of publication, mean follow‐up period and proportion of male patients. The ICD complication reported in the NCDR ICD registry is significantly lower than the RCTs despite a similar population. This may be because it reflects more contemporary data and increased operator experience or because of under‐reporting of complications in registries. The manner in which ICD complications are reported in RCTs and registries is however very variable and there is a need to standardise this practice across the board. (Figure presented).

AB: Background Randomised clinical trials (RCT) are considered a gold standard generating efficacy and safety data supporting drug approval. However, real world data (RWD) reflecting health care delivery is becoming increasingly important. RWD on patient profiles and patterns of care in MBC are scarce in developing countries. As an example, observational studies suggest that despite guideline recommendations clearly indicating ET for hormone receptor positive MBC, a considerable proportion of patients in clinical practice begin chemotherapy in early lines of therapy. This pragmatic information addresses the uptake and applicability of the RCT results and should be able to help informing health care planning complementing RCT generated data. The objective of this study is to describe patient characteristics and evaluate actual physician‐reported treatments for MBC in Brazil. Methods This analysis addresses the first 362 patients included in LACOG‐0312, a retrospective study planning to recruit over 700 patients (cut‐off date April 30th 2016) with recurrent locally advanced or MBC diagnosed in 2012 in 18 institutions across Brazil. Patient characteristics, type of health insurance coverage, treatment and survival outcome were analysed. Results Median age at BC diagnosis was 53 years and 37% were premenopausal. Regarding the educational level, 63.2% had completed elementary (primary) schooling, 75.7% were covered by the public health system while 24.3% had some form of private coverage. 70% of patients had hormone receptor positive (HR+) and 18% had HER2 positive tumors. Median disease free survival time from surgery was 29 months. Interestingly, 30% of patients underwent a biopsy of a metastatic site. Of the 362 patients, 349 (96.9%) received some form of palliative systemic therapy. Median time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to first‐line therapy initiation was 46 days but a significant difference was noted between patients with public versus private health insurance (50 vs. 33 days p=0.012). Half of the patients received at least 3 lines of therapy (chemo or endocrine) to a maximum of 9 lines. In patients with HR+ tumors, endocrine therapy was administered in 47% in first, 65% in second and 61% in third‐line, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) from diagnosis of metastatic disease was 34 months (CI 95%: 25.7‐44.3) and no differences in OS were observed between patients with public or private coverage (34 months vs. 35 months p=0.808). Causes of death were cancer in 85.2% of patients and treatment toxicity in 3.6%. Conclusion Our study included a population with predominantly low educational level and mostly public health insurance. This likely corresponds to the majority of cases and reflects cancer care patterns in Brazil and many developing countries. A considerable proportion of patients were premenopausal at MBC diagnosis. More than half of HR+ patients received at least 3 lines of endocrine therapy although 54% of them had chemotherapy as the first systemic treatment. Patients from the public health system experienced a delay in starting first‐line therapy but this didn't seem to jeopardize cancer outcomes in this setting.

AB: Relapsed and refractory lymphoma has historically been treated using various salvage chemotherapy regimens including dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatin (DHAP) and ifosfamide, epirubicin and etoposide (IVE). These regimens require an inpatient stay and have significant toxicity. A recent trial in aggressive non‐Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) (Crump et al. [2014] J Clin Oncol 32(31):3490) showed similar clinical outcomes using gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin (GDP) leading the Northern Cancer Network to adopt GDP salvage chemotherapy. Our initial data analysis supported the hypothesis that toxicity rates were similar in both groups and inpatient stays were reduced with GDP. Twelve months on, we further analysed our follow up data to establish whether clinical outcomes were similar between the two groups. We retrospectively recorded data from clinical records for cohorts of consecutively treated patients with aggressive NHL in 2014 and 2015. 17 patients received 33 cycles of IVE/DHAP in 2014 and 16 patients received 47 cycles of GDP in 2015 across three centres. 59% (10/17) of IVE/DHAP and 81% (13/16) of GDP patients received at least two cycles of treatment. Mean length of stay in the GDP cohort was 2 days compared to 10 days in the IVE/DHAP cohort. Readmission rate after GDP was 13% (6/47) compared to 45% (15/33) after IVE/DHAP. 71% (15/21) of readmissions were due to febrile neutropenia. Post‐salvage autologous transplant rates were 18% (3/17) in the IVE/DHAP group compared to 25% (4/16) in the GDP group. Allogeneic transplant was performed in 6% (1/17) of IVE/DHAP and 19% (3/16) of GDP group. Of transplanted patients the 12 month overall survival (OS) was 3/4 in the IVE/DHAP cohort and 7/7 in the GDP cohort. Patients were not transplanted after salvage chemotherapy in 22 cases due to progressive disease (16/33), death (3/33), partial response (2/33) and co‐morbidity (1/33). 12 month OS and 12 month event free survival (EFS: events classified as change in treatment or evidence of clinical/radiological progression) were 41% (7/17) and 12% (2/17) respectively in the IVE/ DHAP cohort and 56% (9/16) and 44% (7/16) in the GDP cohort. These real world data from unselected patient cohorts demonstrate similar OS to that reported by Crump et al. 12 month OS was approximately 49% in both arms of Crump et al's trial compared to 41% (7/17) in the DHAP/IVE cohort and 56% (9/16) in the GDP cohort in our study. Crump et al. reported that 87% of IVE/DHAP and 90% of GDP patients received at least two cycles of treatment. The reduced numbers of patients in our cohort receiving more than two cycles of treatment may be due to a less restrictive selection policy for salvage chemotherapy. Our data in terms of OS support the role of transplantation in consolidating remissions. Our rates of transplantation were lower than Crump et al. and again this is likely due to the unselected nature of the patients receiving salvage treatments. This study, although small, supports Crump et al's findings of shorter inpatient stays, reduced readmission rates and similar EFS and OS with GDP compared to IVE/DHAP salvage chemotherapy in our unselected patient cohorts.

AB: Background/Purpose: Real‐world data on adherence to TNFa inhibitors in patients with RA are missing from many regions, including the Middle East. This study evaluated the real‐world 1‐ and 5‐year adherence to etanercept (ETN) among Iraqi patients with RA. Methods: This observational, retrospective study assessed patient data entered in the National Center of Rheumatology in Iraq database during the period May 2012 ‐ May 2017. Individuals aged >18 years, with a diagnosis of RA, and who required treatment with ETN, with or without MTX, were identified and included in the analysis. Those previously treated with a different biologic or who were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial were excluded. Adherence was assessed for 1‐ and 5‐year periods, with 1‐year adherence defined as 7 consecutive patient visits. Demographics, Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and adverse events (AEs) data were also collected. Editorial support was provided by Charlene Rivera, PhD, and Vojislav Pejovic, PhD, of Engage Scientific Solutions and was funded by Pfizer. Results: In total, data from 1293 individuals were collected. Approximately half (51.7%, n=668) were treated concomitantly with MTX and 40.4% were taking prednisolone. At baseline, the mean (± standard deviation) disease duration was 10.0 ± 8.3 years, and mean CDAI and DAS28 scores were 27.6 ± 13.0 and 5.7 ± 2.0, respectively. The adherence to treatment at 1 year was 86.5% (n=1119) for all patients and 85.5% (n=571) for those also receiving MTX. Among patients who discontinued treatment at 1 year, 75.2% (n=112) did not specify a reason, 20.8% (n=31) reported lack of efficacy, and 4.0% (n=6) reported side effects as reasons for discontinuation. Patients who discontinued treatment at 1 year due to side effects or other unspecified reasons had significantly improved CDAI and DAS28 scores at the last follow‐up visit compared with baseline scores (16.3 and 19.9 vs 26.3 and 26.3 for CDAI, respectively; 4.5 and 4.8 vs 5.4 and 5.5 for DAS28, respectively; p≤0.001). The adherence at 5 years was 61.3% (50.4% for patients treated concomitantly with MTX). Among patients who discontinued treatment at 5 years, 84.6% did not specify a reason, 12.2% reported lack of efficacy, and 3.2% reported side effects as reasons for discontinuation. Average CDAI and DAS28 scores significantly decreased at the last follow‐up visit compared with baseline among patients still on treatment at 5 years (19.9 vs 26.6 and 4.7 vs 5.6, respectively; p=0.001). Conclusion: A majority of real‐world Iraqi patients with RA were adherent to ETN treatment after 5 years. Furthermore, most patients tolerated treatment with ETN and had significant improvements in treatment scores at 5 years. Adherence was higher among patients in the total population compared with the subset receiving concomitant MTX.

AB: Background Prior to recent FDA approval of lurasidone for treatment of bipolar depression there were only two approved treatments for this condition (quetiapine and olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination), and these were as likely to provide therapeutic benefit as adverse effects. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lurasidone for major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, using number needed to treat (NNT, for benefits), number needed to harm (NNH, for harms), and likelihood of being helped or harmed (LHH, ratio of NNH to NNT, for trade‐offs between benefits vs. harms). Methods Data was collected from two 6‐week multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, flexibly‐dosed acute bipolar I depression studies, one using lurasidone monotherapy at 20‐60 mg/d or 80‐120 mg/d, and the other using lurasidone 20‐120 mg/d adjunctive to lithium or valproate. The NNT or NNH was calculated for lurasidone vs. placebo for the following dichotomous outcomes: response (≥50% reduction from baseline on Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score); remission (final MADRS total score ≤12); discontinuation due to an adverse event (AE); weight gain ≥7% from baseline; incidence of spontaneously reported AEs; and incidence of total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dl, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥160 mg/dl, fasting triglycerides ≥200 mg/dl and glucose ≥126 mg/dl post‐baseline. Results NNT vs. placebo for response was 5 for lurasidone monotherapy (both dose ranges) and 7 for adjunctive therapy. NNT vs. placebo for remission for lurasidone monotherapy was 6 for 20‐60 mg/d and 7 for 80‐120 mg/d and 7 for adjunctive lurasidone. NNH vs. placebo for discontinuation due to an AE for lurasidone monotherapy was 642 for 20‐60 mg/d and ‐181 for 80‐120 mg/d, and for adjunctive lurasidone was ‐54 (negative NNH denotes an advantage for lurasidone). Lurasidone was not associated with any clinically meaningful mean weight or metabolic changes compared to placebo; NNH vs. placebo for weight gain ≥7% was 29 for 20‐60 mg/d and 5550 for 80‐120 mg/d and 42 for adjunctive lurasidone. The three most frequently occurring AEs with the largest difference in incidence for lurasidone vs. placebo were nausea, akathisia, and somnolence, with NNH values for lurasidone vs. placebo ranging from 11 (nausea with lurasidone monotherapy 80‐120 mg/d) to 130 (somnolence with lurasidone monotherapy 20‐60 mg/d). LHH was substantially and consistently >1 (indicating benefit being more likely than harm) when contrasting response or remission vs. AEs or weight gain. Limitations Additional studies, including longer‐term and open‐label, "real world" data is needed to confirm the results reported here. Conclusions NNT, NNH, and LHH help quantify relative benefits (efficacy) and harms (side effects), thus placing lurasidone findings in research studies into clinical perspective. Lurasidone, compared to other treatments approved for bipolar depression, yielded comparable benefits (all had single‐digit NNT vs. placebo for response or remission), and less risk of harm (double‐digit or greater NNHs with lurasidone compared to single‐digit NNHs for sedation with quetiapine and for ≥7% weight gain with olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination), and thus a substantially more favorable LHH (> or >>1) with lurasidone monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, compared to quetiapine and olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination (LHH<or ~1). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB: Background: Daclatasvir (DCV) combined with asunaprevir (ASV) was the first all‐oral treatment to be approved in Japan for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) serogroup 1 infection in patients with/without compensated cirrhosis. We report interim findings of a post‐marketing survey of DCV + ASV in Japanese patients treated in the routine clinical setting. Methods: The survey aimed to register a total of 3000 HCV‐infected patients, including 1000 patients with compensated cirrhosis, between September 2014 and August 2015. All patients received oral DCV 60 mg once daily + ASV 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. Patient background, administration status, concomitant medication, and measures of safety and efficacy were recorded. This report includes safety data collected up to 3 July 2016. Result: Of the 3089 patients registered, 2165 (70.0%) patients (female, n = 1233 [57.0%]; mean age, 69.1 years [range 21‐92]; compensated cirrhosis, n = 862 [39.8%]) are included in the safety set; 1874 (86.6%) patients have completed the treatment period. The main reasons for discontinuation in the safety set were adverse events (n = 146 [6.7%]) and lack of efficacy (n = 86 [4.0%]). A total of 538 patients (24.85%) in the safety set experienced a total of 811 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Events corresponding to the composite ADR term 'hepatic function disorder' occurred in 315 patients (14.55%). Common ADRs were: hepatic function abnormal (n = 133 [6.14%]), increased eosinophil count (n = 67 [3.09%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (n = 63 [2.91%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (n = 61 [2.82%]), liver disorder (n = 58 [2.68%]) and pyrexia (n = 53 [2.45%]); rates of ADRs in patients with/without compensated cirrhosis were generally comparable (Table 1). Serious ADRs which occurred in two or more patients were liver disorder (n = 5 [0.23%]), pyrexia (n = 4 [0.18%]); hepatic function abnormal (n = 3 [0.14%]) hepatic encephalopathy (n = 2 [0.09%]) and jaundice (n = 2 [0.09%]); all serious ADRs have/are resolved/resolving and all patients have/are recovered/recovering. No deaths have been reported. Differences in the rate and frequency of ADRs were observed when analysed by sex (male, n = 203/932 [21.78%]; female, n = 335/1233 [27.17%]), age (<60 years, n = 70/321 [21.81%]; >80 years, n = 66/226 [29.20%]), BMI (<18.5 kg/m2, n = 105/321 [34.29%]; 35‐<40 kg/m2, n = 7/43 [16.28%]), and renal function (CrCl C80 mL/min, n = 111/543 [20.44%]; CrCl <50 mL/min, n = 60/ 185 [31.16%]). Conclusion: DCV + ASV was generally well tolerated in this interim analysis of real‐world data. (Table Presented).

AB: Advances in medical treatment options over the past several decades have translated into substantially higher survival rates for those who suffer with chronic illness. Consequently, the prevalence of chronic illness has risen significantly in recent years, such that one out of every four youth in the United States currently lives with a chronic illness. The health and well‐being of these youth is directly impacted by the degree to which they adhere to their treatment regimen. However, treatment regimens for chronic illness can be highly complex, making adherence problematic, particularly when combined with deficits in memory and executive functioning concomitant with many chronic illnesses. Adherence also tends to deteriorate over time; the youth's motivation or commitment to treatment may decline as symptoms improve or negative side effects occur. With low adherence comes worsening symptoms and significantly greater risk for serious medical complications and mortality in young adulthood. The costs associated with low adherence, such as the need for additional care, are also substantial both for the patient and society. While a number of factors have been found to impact treatment adherence, risk for non‐adherence—across varied forms of chronic illness—is markedly elevated when the youth lacks disease‐ and treatment‐related knowledge and when parents provide little supervision for carrying out regimen tasks. With nearly 90% of youth with chronic illness expected to survive and therefore transition from pediatric care into adult‐focused healthcare systems, it is critically important to empower youth to take ownership of their own healthcare. To do so, tools there is a need to provide accessible, affordable tools that can effectively increase patients' skills and knowledge for managing their illness and support on‐going adherence to their treatment regimen. The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of Planet K, a mobile and web‐based technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths' chronic kidney disease‐ and treatment‐related knowledge through interactive and game‐based educational materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via mobile and web‐based delivery; and (c) promote patient‐provider communication through real‐world data collection and feedback loops. Investigators will examine the effectiveness of the Planet K mobile app and website in improving treatment adherence, disease‐related knowledge, transition readiness, condition management, and the psychological correlates of these variables in adolescents and young adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). All participants will complete study measures at pre‐ and post‐assessment time points. In total, participants will take part in this study for approximately 2 months from pre‐ to post‐assessment. Families will be recruited to participate in either the treatment condition or the control group. Families in the treatment condition will receive the Planet K app and access to the associated website for the full duration of the study (4 months) between pre‐test and post‐test. Families in the control group will not receive access to the app and website but instead will be asked to complete a series of online questionnaires at each of the two data collection time points (pre‐test, post‐test). Investigators hypothesize that greater use (i.e., dosage) and prolonged use of Planet K will: increase disease‐related knowledge, treatment adherence, self‐efficacy for management of CKD, current CKD self‐management behaviors, perceived severity of CKD, readiness to transition to independent self‐care, and perceived benefits of CKD treatment, while also decreasing perceived barriers to CKD treatment. Moreover, investigators believe that improvement of these outcomes through use of Planet K will result in more positive mental health outcomes for participants, including lower depression and higher reported quality of life. Investigators expect that those in the treatment condition will have better outcomes than those in the control group on all of these measures at both midpoint and post‐assessment time points. Finally, investigators expect all participants to report high usability, quality, and value of the Planet K mobile app and website and to positively rate their experience with Planet K.

AB: Background: Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced heart failure hospitalization and mortality in PARADIGM‐HF. However, real world data from sacubitril/valsartan use are lacking, which might be useful to overcome hurdles in clinical practice towards its implementation. Methods: We retrospectively assessed all baseline and follow‐up data of consecutive heart failure patients receiving therapy with sacubitril/valsartan according to the Belgian reimbursement criteria, between December 2016 and July 2017 in a single center. Baseline characteristics, follow‐up data and dose titration of sacubitril/valsartan were compared between patients in clinical practice and in PARADIGM‐HF. Results: A total of 120 patients (81% male) received therapy with sacubitril/ valsartan. In comparison to the patients receiving sacubitril/valsartan in PARADIGM‐HF, patients in clinical practice were older, had a higher serum creatinine, higher New York Heart Association (NYHA‐class), lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p‐value all <0.05). Baseline characteristics more closely resembled the patients dropping out during the run‐in faze than patients undergoing actual randomization. Even in comparison to patient experiencing dropout during the run‐in phase, real world patients had a lower SBP (p = 0.008), lower LVEF (p <0.001) and higher creatinine (p = 0.034). Patients were at high absolute baseline risk for adverse outcome as illustrated by the EMPHASIS‐HF risk score of 6(IQR 3), in comparison to 5(IQR4) in PARADIGM‐HF. After initiation of sacubitril/valsartan, NYHA‐class significantly improved (p <0.001). SBP dropped more than reported in PARADIGM‐HF (7.1±8.0mmhg vs. 3.2±0.4mmHg;p <0.001). Other clinical and biochemical factors did not change significantly (see figure). A total of 20.1% of patients tolerated dose uptitration during follow‐up. Symptomatic hypotension (50%) and kidney insufficiency (30%) were the most common reasons for absence of uptitration. Patients received similar RAAS‐inhibition before and after initiation of sacubitril/valsartan (57±29 vs 55±27% of target dose p= 0.672), indicating optimal switch and uptitration of sacubitril/valsartan. However in comparison to patients enrolled in PARADIGM‐HF, patients in clinical practice received a significant lower dose of sacubitril/valsartan (219±122mg vs. 375±75mg;p <0.001). Conclusion: Patients in clinical practice exhibit baseline characteristics that were associated with dropout during the run‐in faze of PARADIGM‐HF, which might lead to prescription of lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan in clinical practice. Nevertheless, patients in clinical practice are at high risk of adverse outcome, as illustrated by the EMPHASIS‐HF risk score. As the relative risk reducing capacity of sacubitril/ valsartan does not decreases in higher risk patients, the absolute risk reduction effect of sacubitril/valsartan might be more pronounced in patients encountered in clinical practice.

AB: Introduction: One of the most effective chemotherapies for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is nab‐paclitaxel (nab‐P) which is approved for the treatment of MBC after failure of 1st‐line therapy and when anthracyclines are not indicated. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have shown high efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Real world data of nab‐P in MBC, however, are still limited. Methods: The prospective multicenter non‐interventional study NABUCCO was designed to collect data on the routine treatment of 700 patients (pts) with MBC in approximately 100 sites across Germany. Primary objective was the time to tumor progression (TTP), secondary objectives were overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), the dosage scheme of nab‐P, time on treatment, safety parameters and quality of life. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. TTP and OS were calculated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Results: Between 4/2012 and 4/2015 705 pts with MBC at 128 active sites had been enrolled. 697 patients were evaluable with a median follow‐up of 17.7 months. Baseline characteristics: Median age 62.3 years (range 29.2‐89.3), age > 65 years n = 291 (41.8%), ECOG PS > 2 n = 49 (7.0%), prior taxanes 419 pts (60.1%). Pts were treated at the physician's discretion. The application mode of nab‐P was as follows: 260 mg/m2 q3w (n = 153, 22.0%), > 15% reduced dose q3w (n = 37, 5.3%), 150 mg/m2 d1, d8, d15 q4w (n = 54, 7.7%), > 15% reduced dose d1, d8, d15 q4w (n = 219, 31.4%), 100‐125 mg/m2 d1,8,15 q3w (n = 90, 12.9%) and other (n = 144, 20.7%). Pts received nab‐P as 1st‐line (n = 280, 40.2%), 2nd‐line (n = 169, 24.2%), 3rd‐line (n = 141, 20.2%) or > 4th line (n = 107, 15.4%) therapy. Median TTP for all pts was 5.9 months (95% CI 5.6‐6.4), with a median TTP of 7.1 months (95% CI 6.0‐8.6) for 1st‐line, 6.0 months (95% CI 5.5‐7.3) for 2nd line, 5.6 months (95% CI 4.6‐6.7) for 3rd line and 5.2 months (95% CI 4.2‐5.6) for > 4th line treatment. ORR was 37.2% for all pts, 46.1% for 1st line, 30.2% for 2nd line, 31.9% for 3rd line, and 29.0% for > 4th line treatment, respectively. 34.3% of patients developed adverse events grade 3/4 which included leukopenia (7.9%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.3%) and infections (4.2%). Further subgroup analyses will be presented. Conclusions: The results of the NABUCCO study confirm the clinical trial outcomes and the favorable benefit‐risk profile of nab‐P in patients with MBC in a real‐life setting.

AB: Background/Purpose: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its treatment have significant impacts on health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), work productivity (WP) and activity participation. Data are limited comparing the magnitude of impacts observed in routine clinical practice and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This study evaluated the impact of RA on HRQoL, WP and activity participation among adult RA patients in the US general population compared with patients from two sarilumab pivotal phase 3 RCTs. Sarilumab is a human anti‐IL‐6Ra monoclonal antibody for treatment of moderate‐to‐severely active RA. Methods: 'Real world' data were from adult participants of the cross‐sectional 2015 US National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) with a patient‐reported diagnosis of RA, moderate/severe disease activity and administered diseasemodifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at the point of survey. RCT data were from MOBILITY ‐ Part B and TARGET trials comparing the efficacy and safety of sarilumab subcutaneous (SC) 150 mg and 200 mg every 2 weeks (q2w)plus methotrexate in MOBILITY or conventional DMARDs in TARGET versus placebo in patients with moderateto‐ severely active RA and inadequate responses to methotrexate (MTX‐IR, MOBILITY) or tumor necrosis factors inhibitors (TNF‐IR, TARGET). HRQoL was measured using the Short Form‐36v2 (SF‐36v2) in the NHWS, and both RCTs at baseline and Week 24; WP impairment (WPI) and activity impairment (AI) were measured via the WPAI scale in the NHWS and MOBILITY. Bivariate analyses evaluated between‐group differences in SF‐36v2 physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary and domain scores and WPAI absenteeism, presenteeism (%work time missed), overall WPI and AI. Results: Mean ages of the analyzed cohorts were 54, 51 and 53 years; 61%, 82%, and 80% were female, respectively in NHWS (n=2016), MOBILITY (n=799) and TARGET (n=365). At baseline, versus NHWS patients, those enrolled in MOBILITY reported greater presenteeism (47.25 vs 37.50; P < 0.001), overall WPI (51.29 vs 43.11; P = 0.001) and AI (62.42 vs 50.96; P < 0.001). Patients in MOBILITY and TARGET reported significantly lower baseline scores versus NHWS in SF‐36v2 PCS (31.27, 29.42 vs 38.54) MCS (38.86, 38.73 vs 43.97), and all domain scores (P < 0.001; Figure) indicating greater HRQoL impairment. At Week 24 both trial cohorts reported improved HRQOL (Figure) and AI in MOBILITY (34.08 vs 39.76, respectively; P< 0.05) following treatment with sarilumab than the NHWS cohort scores. Conclusion: Patients in both sarilumab RCTs reported worse baseline HRQoL, and in MOBILITY greater WPI and AI than NHWS RA patients. After 24 weeks treatment with sarilumab, both RCT cohorts reported improvements exceeding NHWS scores, with few exceptions. These data offer perspective on the benefits of sarilumab treatment on HRQOL, WP and AI.

AB: Objectives: In a recent meta‐analysis, neither rheumatoid factor (RF) nor anti‐cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti‐CCP) antibody status were associated with clinical response to treatment with anti‐TNF agents.1 In contrast, anti‐CCP positivity may be associated with increased abatacept efficacy in patients (pts) with prior biologic failure,2 and in biologic‐naive pts.3 In this analysis, the efficacy of abatacept after 6 months' follow‐up in biologic‐naive pts enrolled in the ACTION study was compared in RF/anti‐CCP‐positive versus ‐negative pts. Methods: ACTION is a 2‐year, international, multicenter, prospective, observational study evaluating retention and effectiveness of IV abatacept in pts with RA. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were evaluated at 6 months and compared for anti‐CCP/RF‐positive and ‐negative pts who were biologic naive using analysis of variance on ranks for quantitative variables and Fisher exact tests for qualitative variables. EULAR response was based on DAS28 (ESR or CRP) and derived from individual core components, as were mean CDAI and Boolean remission. Results: In 672 biologic‐naive pts, RF status was reported in 577 (86%) pts (412 [71%] positive) and anti‐CCP antibody status in 552 (82%) pts (3 [66%] positive); 308/511 (60%) pts were double positive and 127/511 (25%) pts were double negative. Clinical outcomes at 6 months were more beneficial for pts who were RF (p = 0.012) or anti‐CCP (p = 0.015) positive versus negative, including EULAR good or moderate response versus no response; mean (95% CI) CDAI (calculated) (RF: 10.8 [9.8, 11.8] vs 15.3 [13.4, 17.2]; p < 0.001; anti‐CCP: 10.9 [9.8, 12.0] vs 14.3 [12.4, 16.2]; p = 0.002) and Boolean remission (RF: 13.3% vs 4.0%; p = 0.008; anti‐CCP: 12.5% vs 6.3%; p = 0.096). Similarly, significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed for pts who were RF/anti‐CCP single positive or double positive versus double negative, (p = 0.011 and p = 0.008 respectively), including EULAR good or moderate response versus no response; mean (95% CI) CDAI (calculated) (11.1 [10.2, 12.1] and 10.5 [9.3, 11.6] vs 14.5 [12.3, 16.7]; p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively) and Boolean remission (12.3% and 13.8% vs 3.8%; p = 0.025 and p = 0.013, respectively). Conclusion: These are the first prospective real‐world data showing superior efficacy of abatacept in biologic‐naive pts who are RF and/or anti‐CCP positive versus negative, even when using stringent remission criteria. The association between autoantibody status and clinical outcomes with abatacept may be linked to the mechanism of action.

AB: Background‐Aims: The regimens of OBV/PRV/r +/‐ DSV +/‐ ribavirin (RBV) were demonstrated to be safe and efficacious achieving high 12‐week sustained virological response rates (SVR12) of >95% in phase III trials. However, real‐world data are limited. We assessed the efficacy and safety of those regimen in chronic HCV patients with genotype 1 (GT1) or 4 (GT4) treated at tertiary Greek Liver Centers. Patients‐Methods: All included patients fulfilled the national criteria for treatment reimbursement with DAAs (F3 experienced, F4, decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation, severe extrahepatic manifestations). The combination of OBV/PRV/r+DSV+RBV was given in GT1a, OBV/PRV/r+DSV+/‐RBV in GT1b and OBV/PRV/r+RBV in GT4 patients. The duration of treatment was usually 12 (n=176) and rarely 24 weeks (n=6). Efficacy was estimated by SVR12 and severe adverse events (SAEs) were reported in all patients who received >1 drug dose. Results: A total of 182 patients (93 males) with a median age of 57.5 (range: 30‐82) years and BMI of 26.5 kg/m2 were included. GT1a was present in 20, GT1b in 89 and GT4 in 73 patients. The severity of liver disease was F0‐2 in 12, F3 in 49, F4 in 116 and decompensated cirrhosis in 5 patients. The majority of patients (67.5%) were treatment‐experienced (failures after interferon‐based treatment in 113, protease inhibitors in 3, sofosbuvir‐based treatment in 7). Median baseline lab values were: ALT 54 IU/L, albumin 4.0 g/dL, Hb 13.6 g/dL, platelets 170.000/mm3, HCV RNA 1.13 x106 IU/ml. At the time of analysis, SVR12 data were available for 112 patients. The overall SVR12 was 92% (103/112). Specifically, in GT1a: 91.6% (11/12), in GT1b: 89.2% (50/56) and in GT4: 95.4% (42/44). In GT1b patients, SVR12 was achieved in 91% (21/23) of those treated with OBV/PRV/r+DSV and 88% (29/33) of those treated with OBV/PRV/r+DSV+RBV. SVR12 was observed in 7/8 (87.5%) patients with F0‐2, 30/32 (93.8%) patients with F3, 66/70 (94%) patients with F4 and 0/2 patients with decompensated cirrhosis. SAEs during treatment were observed in 10 patients (5.5%). Three patients died (2 from non‐liver related reasons, 1 with decompensated cirrhosis due to sepsis). Treatment was discontinued in 4 patients (death in 2, aplastic anemia in 1, severe diarrhea in 1). Two patients developed jaundice and 2 anemia, but they all continued treatment and 3 of them have achieved SVR12. Conclusions: In our real‐world cohort, treatment with OBV/PRV/r +/‐DSV +/‐RBV was well tolerated, had low rates of SAEs or treatment discontinuation and achieved high SVR rates in GT1 and GT4 chronic HCV naive or treatment experienced patients, mostly with severe fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis.

DOI: 10.1158/15387445.SABCS18-P4-14-05
AB: Background: The TAILORx study (NCT00310180)(TRx) has demonstrated the efficacy of endocrine therapy alone in early stage, lymph node negative, hormone receptor positive, her2neu oncogene negative breast cancer harboring an intermediate recurrence score (RS) on a 21‐gene profile (OncotypeDx), obviating the need for adjuvant chemotherapy in a large subset of women. The study randomized and followed 6711 patients (PTS) and required 9 years to reach its conclusion endpoints. The availability of the electronic health record (EHR) permits automated reviews, facilitating more rapid "real world" hypothesis testing (but not a replacement for randomized clinical trials), especially when there are clear variations in common practice patterns. However physician bias in treatment selection needs to be considered. Methods: A retrospective review of the Cota Observational Cancer database, drawn from EHRs, of female pts with breast cancer who were 18 to 75 years of age? had hormone‐receptor‐positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)‐negative, axillary node‐negative breast cancer harboring an OncotypeDx RS 11‐25 receiving adjuvant therapy following surgical resection of a 11‐50 mm primary tumor (similar to TRx eligibility). Results: 1009 pts from 23 cancer centers (107 oncologists) were identified, 850 (84.2%) received adjuvant endocrine therapy alone (E) and 159 (15.8%) received adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy (CE) as part of standard care (no randomization). 285 pts were age <50 yrs (E:218, CE:67) and 601 pts has RS 16‐25 (E:453, CE:148). Treatment selection was imbalanced with oncologists more likely to utilize CE in younger pts (median age E: 59 yrs, CE: 53 yrs? p<0.01), larger tumors (median tumor size E: 16mm, CE: 20mm? p<0.001) and higher RS (median RS E: 16, CE: 21? p<0.001). With a median follow‐up for survival since diagnosis of 3.7 years, the Kaplan‐Meier estimated 5 yr overall survival rates were 98.9% with E and 97.8% with CE (p=0.23)? the corresponding 5‐yr OS in TRx were E: 98% and C: 98.1%. With a median 1.7 years follow‐up for recurrence, 19 pts have suffered a disease distant or local recurrence (E: 13, CE: 6) yielding a 5‐year recurrence‐free survival of E: 95.2% and CE: 91% (p=0.05)? the corresponding TRx result was E: 96.9% and CE: 97%. The 5‐yr invasive disease‐free survival (IDFS = death, local/distant, second primary) with 32 events was E: 92.7% and CE: 81.9% (p= 0.05)? corresponding TRx E: 92.8 % and CE: 93.1%. Given the imbalance in treatment allocations, a multivariate analysis was performed, with older age (<0.001), CE choice (<0.006) and larger tumor size (p<0.05) remaining significant, but not increased RS (p=0.16) for 5‐year IDFS. Among women age <50 with RS 16‐25 (E: 118? CE: 60) the 5‐yr IDFS was E: 95% and CE: 94%? the corresponding RS 16‐20 TRx E: 92% and CE: 94.7% and RS 21‐25 E: 86.3% and CE: 92.1%. Conclusions: Using a real world data source, endocrine therapy alone appears to yield excellent 5‐yr survival rates among pts with 21‐gene RS 11‐25 similar to the TAILORx trial. Treatment selection bias (with perceived higher risk pts allocated to CE) and shorter median follow‐up limits full confirmation by this dataset.

AB: Background: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the risk of death. Limited real‐world data has shown high efficacy of co‐formulated ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) in genotype (GT) 4‐infected patients with stage 4‐5 CKD. We examined the efficacy and safety of OBV/PTV/r, given with or without ribavirin (RBV) in treatment‐naïve and interferon (IFN) experienced CKD patients. Methods: In this ongoing multicenter phase 3b, randomized, open‐label trial, eligible participants were recruited from 5 centers in Saudi Arabia. Participants were non‐cirrhotic, stage 4‐5 CKD, with chronic HCV GT4 infection (≥6 months before screening) and HCV RNA levels higher than 1,000 IU/mL. Treatment‐naive patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer‐generated randomization lists to receive once‐daily OBV/PTV/r with or without RBV 200 mg for 12 weeks. All previous IFN‐treated patients received the RBV‐containing regimen. The primary endpoint was a sustained virologic response (HCV RNA <15 IU/mL) 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT) as well as a modified ITT (mITT) analysis for patients who had completed at least 12 weeks of post treatment follow‐up. This study is registered with sfda.gov.sa, number SCTR17021402. Results: Overall, 28 patients were treatment‐naive, of whom 15 received OBV/ PTV/r and 13 received OBV/PTV/r with RBV, and 15 were treatment‐experienced who received the RBV‐containing regimen, and all were hemodialysis dependent. Of the 43 patients who received at least one dose of study medication, six were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis for nonvirological reasons (death [n=5], patient withdrawal [n=1]). Interim mITT analysis revealed no virologic failures in the three treatment arms, with SVR4 (n=38) and SVR12 (n=31) rates of 100% each. Virologic efficacy was high regardless of GT4 subtype (4a=26, 4d=9, others=8). On an ITT analysis, in treatment‐naive patients, SVR12 rates were 71.4% (10/14) in the RBV‐free and 90.9% (10/11) in the RBV‐containing regimen. In treatment‐experienced patients SVR12 was 91.7% (11/12). Six patients (11.6%) had serious adverse events leading to treatment failure, including 5 deaths (3 ontreatment deaths [2 sepsis‐related, 1 with cardiac arrest], and 2 post‐treatment deaths [cerebral ischemia] 8 weeks after completing therapy) and none were considered treatmentrelated; 1 patient withdrew from the study due to on‐treatment ileus. Dose interruptions of study medications, including RBV, were noted in 7 (16.3%), predominantly in the RBVcontaining arms (5/28, 17.9%) for hemoglobin less than 100 g/L. Conclusion: Treatment with the OBV/PTV/r regimen is effective in GT4 non‐cirrhotic patients with stage 4‐5 CKD, achieving high SVR12 rate. RBV use impacted on‐treatment adherence rate resulting in frequent dose interruptions but did not impact virologic efficacy.

AB: Backround Randomised clinical trials (RCT) are considered a gold standard generating efficacy and safety data supporting drug approval. However, real world data (RD) reflecting health care delivery is becoming increasingly important. RD on patient profiles and patterns of care in MBC are scarce in developing countries. As an example, observational studies suggest that despite guideline recommendations clearly indicating ET for hormone receptor positive MBC, a considerable proportion of patients in clinical practice begin chemotherapy in early lines of therapy. This pragmatic information addresses the uptake and applicability of the RCT results and should be able to help informing health care planning complementing RCT generated data. The objective of this study is to describe patient characteristics and evaluate actual physician‐reported treatments for MBC in Brazil. Methods This analysis addresses the first 362 patients included in LACOG‐0312, a retrospective study planning to recruit over 700 patients (cut‐off date April 30th 2016) with recurrent locally advanced or MBC diagnosed in 2012 in 18 institutions across Brazil. Patient characteristics, type of health insurance coverage, treatment and survival outcome were analysed. Results Median age at BC diagnosis was 53 years and 37% were premenopausal. Regarding the educational level, 63.2% had completed elementary (primary) schooling, 75.7% were covered by the public health system while 24.3% had some form of private coverage. 70% of patients had hormone receptor positive (HR) and 18% had HER2 positive tumors. Median disease free survival time from surgery was 29 months. Interestingly, 30% of patients underwent a biopsy of a metastatic site. Of the 362 patients, 349 (96.9%) received some form of palliative systemic therapy. Median time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to first‐line therapy initiation was 46 days but a significant difference was noted between patients with public versus private health insurance (50 vs. 33 days p 0.012). Half of the patients received at least 3 lines of therapy (chemo or endocrine) to a maximum of 9 lines. In patients with HR tumors, endocrine therapy was administered in 47% in first, 65% in second and 61% in third‐line, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) from diagnosis of metastatic disease was 34 months (CI 95%: 25.7‐44.3) and no differences in OS were observed between patients with public or private coverage (34 months vs. 35 months p 0.808). Causes of death were cancer in 85.2% of patients and treatment toxicity in 3.6%. Conclusion Our study included a population with predominantly low educational level and mostly public health insurance. This likely corresponds to the majority of cases and reflects cancer care patterns in Brazil and many developing countries. A considerable proportion of patients were premenopausal at MBC diagnosis. More than half of HR patients received at least 3 lines of endocrine therapy although 54% of them had chemotherapy as the first systemic treatment. Patients from the public health system experienced a delay in starting first‐line therapy but this didnt seem to jeopardize cancer outcomes in this setting.

AB: Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of the use of drug‐eluting coronary artery stents in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with coronary artery disease. Data sources: Bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, were searched from December 2002 to August 2005. Hand‐searching was also done. Review methods: A systematic literature review of effectiveness was conducted focusing primarily on randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Full economic evaluations that compared two or more options and considered both costs and consequences were eligible for inclusion in the economics review. A critique of manufacturer submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and an economic evaluation in the form of cost‐utility analysis were also carried out. Results: In the 17 RCTs of drug‐eluting stents (DES) versus bare metal stents (BMS), no statistically significant differences in mortality or myocardial infarction (MI) were identified up to 3 years. Significant reductions in repeat revascularisations were determined for DES compared with BMS [for example, at 1 year: target lesion revascularisation (TLR) relative risk 0.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.31; and target vessel revascularisation (TVR) relative risk 0.43; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.55]. This estimated benefit appears to be stable from 1 to 3 years. Binary restenosis and late luminal loss also favoured DES. In the eight RCTs of DES versus DES, no statistically significant differences in mortality or MI were detected between DES designs. In meta‐analyses of TLR, TVR and composite event rate, marginal improvement in efficacy of Cypher™ over Taxus™ was observed. These results await confirmation beyond 1 year and differences in study design may have influenced reporting of outcomes. Ten full economic evaluations were included in the review and the balance of evidence indicated that DES are more cost‐effective in higher risk patients. The review of submitted models confirmed the view that DES may be cost‐effective only under very limited circumstances when realistic assumptions and data values were used. In the cost‐utility analysis of DES versus BMS, the use of DES appears to reduce the rate of repeat revascularisations; benefit estimates used in the economic assessment are defined as 'broad' (i.e. cases involving any TLR/TVR irrespective of any other lesions/vessels undergoing revascularisation) and 'narrow' (i.e. cases involving TLR/TVR only). The incremental benefit to the patient is therefore described as the loss of quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) avoided by not having to undergo a repeat revascularisation. Univariate sensitivity analysis and extreme values analysis indicate that the price premium, numbers of stents used in the index procedure and absolute risk reduction in repeat interventions most significantly influence the cost‐effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses also permit a range of values for efficacy and effectiveness to be considered for individual designs of DES. The cost‐effectiveness results reveal that, all patients considered together, the calculated cost per QALY ratios are high £183,000‐562,000) and outside the normal range of acceptability. Cost‐effectiveness is only achieved for those non‐elective patients who have undergone a previous coronary artery bypass graft and have small vessels. 'Real‐world' data show that patient numbers in this latter group are very small (one in 3100 of all patients treated with PCI). Conclusions: The conclusions of the assessment are that the use of DES would be best targeted at the subgroups of patients with the highest risks of requiring reintervention, and could be considered cost‐effective in only a small percentage of such patents. This is similar to the conclusion of our previous assessment. Trials of DES compared with new generation BMS and with DES would be useful, as would further evaluation of newer BMS in combination with drug administration. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

AB: Introduction Improvement in overall surviVal (OS) is seen primarily within standard risk Multiple Myeloma (MM), however, high risk MM OS was still around 2‐3 years until recently. Del1 7p is a genomic imbalance which includes deletion of the TP53 locus. It occurs in ~7‐10% of MM at diagnosis and is associated with extramedullar disease and is a strong poor prognostic factor. Recently approved novel agents and combinations have demonstrated improved outcomes also in patients with negative cytogenetic features; however, their long term impact remains to be seen. Access to newer agents depends on time of diagnosis as well as aVailability of clinical trials, access programs and insurance coverage. The goal of this study is to analyze real world data including treatment patterns and outcomes among MM patients carrying 1 7p deletion, in a retrospective multi‐site study. Methods An obserVational, retrospective, multi‐center study. Consecutive patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the 8 participating centers in Israel, diagnosed between 1.1.2008‐3.1.2016 that were proven to carry 17p deletion by means of FISH studies (any % of plasma cells), were identified by searching hospital records including cytogenetic lab records. Data concerning patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment regimens and clinical endpoints were collected. Results A total of 57 patients carrying 17p deletion of FISH were identified. Patient's characteristics are described in table. Notably, most patients had bone disease; extramedullary disease (EMD) rate was relatively high, as was the presence of additional high risk FISH abnormalities. Most patients received a bortezomib‐based induction, over half underwent ASCT. Fifteen (26%) of the patients participated in clinical trials or access programs (or both) (table). Overall response rate (ORR) after induction was 84%, response rate declined in subsequent treatment lines (figure 1). The median follow‐up was 21 (range, 4‐94) months. Median overall surviVal (OS) was 43 months; Median Progression free surviVal (PFS) was 20 months (figure 2A, B). In uniVariate analysis, presence of extra‐medullary disease at diagnosis was associated with worse PFS (7.4 vs. 21.4 months, p=0.05, figure 2C); presence of additional high risk FISH findings also trended towards shorter PFS (13.5 vs 21.4 months, p=0.0569), while age, gender, ISS, %plasma cells, % cells with del17p, time of del17p detection, M‐Spike and iFLC levels were not significantly associated with PFS. Among patients with a PFS greater than 6 months, ASCT was associated with a significant improvement in PFS (25.7 vs 9.0 months, p=0.0022 log‐rank test) (figure 2D), 4 patients underwent allotransplant, with a median OS of 69 months. Conclusions Our data confirm the poor prognosis of myeloma patients with del17p, in a multi‐site obserVational setting, and an even worse prognosis in the presence of extramedullary disease and additional high‐risk FISH features. While ORR after induction is similar to that generally expected in a newly diagnosed myeloma patients, responses are shorter and thus PFS is inferior compared to recently reported upfront bortezomib‐based regimens ranging from 30‐40+ months. Responses decline further in subsequent lines yet remain non‐negligible even in adVanced therapeutic lines. Our data support the role of ASCT in these high risk patients, and the potential role of allotransplant in selected patients. High rate of participation in clinical trials and access programs throughout the course of therapy reflects the Valued role of newer agents in the management of myeloma patients.

AB: Background:Patients with polycythemia vera (PV) often present with a broad range of clinical characteristics that may contribute to increased risks of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, including thrombotic events (TE). Limited contemporary real‐world data have been reported about the clinical burden of PV and treatment patterns in the United States. The ongoing REVEAL study collects data on disease burden, clinical management, patient‐reported outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization for patients with PV in the United States. This analysis reports clinical characteristics, including underlying CV risk factors, for patients enrolled in the REVEAL study as of April 28, 2016. Methods: REVEAL is a multicenter, nonrandomized, prospective, observational study enrolling patients >18 years of age with a PV diagnosis who are actively managed in an academic or community setting. For this analysis, data regarding PV disease and diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns were collected at enrollment during usual‐care visits and were based on physician assessment, electronic medical records, and local laboratory values. Ten‐year CV risk factors selected for this analysis were adapted from the Framingham Heart Study for CV diseases. Results: At data cutoff, 2307 patients were available for this analysis. Mean (SD) age was 66.3 (12.2) years, 54.4% were male, 89.9% were white, 62.7% had at least some college education, and 51.1% were retired. Approximately 6% of patients had a family history of PV, primarily in parents (35.1%) and siblings (33.8%). A history of second malignancies was reported for 344 patients (14.9%). The majority of patients (84.6%) were diagnosed with PV based on an abnormal blood test alone or in combination with a bone marrow test. Among patients who were diagnosed with a mutational test (n=1078), 95.2% were diagnosed via an abnormal JAK2V617F test result. Abnormal hemoglobin (57.3%), hematocrit (55.4%), or both (47.5%) were among the most common blood values assessed for PV diagnosis. At diagnosis, 58.5% of patients were classified with high‐risk PV (age >60 years or history of a TE); this percentage increased to 77.3% at REVEAL enrollment. The average (SD) disease duration from diagnosis to enrollment was 5.8 (6.1) years. At enrollment, 91.5% of patients were under active management for PV (phlebotomy +/‐ aspirin, 34.0%; hydroxyurea +/‐ aspirin, 27.0%; and phlebotomy + hydroxyurea +/‐ aspirin, 23.2%). Underlying CV risk factors that were either diagnosed or treated in 86.0% of enrolled patients included hypertension (66.5%), history of smoking (46.2%), current smoking at enrollment (10.9%), obesity (34.2%), hyperlipidemia (27.4%), and diabetes (14.8%). At enrollment, 431 (18.7%) patients reported having >1 TE, including 181 patients who had a TE between PV diagnosis and enrollment. Venous and arterial TEs were reported in 11.1% and 8.6% of patients, respectively. Most commonly reported venous TEs were deep vein thrombosis (5.9%) and pulmonary embolism (2.5%); most common arterial TEs were cerebrovascular arterial thrombosis including transient ischemic attack (5.1%) and acute myocardial infarction (1.7%). Increased rates of TEs were observed among patients with hyperlipidemia (23.6%) and hypertension (21.0%; Table 1), compared with patients who did not have any risk factors (10.5%). Conclusion: A large proportion of patients in the REVEAL study had 1 or more underlying CV risks, including age, hypertension, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, which may contribute to the risk of thrombosis. Longitudinal data from REVEAL will provide a better understanding of how these factors affect CV outcomes over time.

AB: Background: Previously, real‐world baseline characteristics and response monitoring pattern of Chinese CML patients treated with dasatinib were poorly studied and rarely reported. The Chinese dasatinib registry CA180‐518 is a multicenter, observational study that provides us with a unique opportunity to obtain such information. Here we reported baseline characteristics and monitoring adherence of patients enrolled in this study. Methods: Imatinib‐resistant/‐intolerant CML adult patients in any phase, who planned to receive or were receiving dasatinib therapy based on physician's clinical judgement, were enrolled in this study and were separated into 3 cohorts based on their disease phases: chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP). Patients were to be followed until death, withdrawal of consent, end of study or loss of follow‐up. Patient visit schedule, evaluation and treatment decision were determined solely by the physician in their real‐world clinical practice. The first and the second patient visits were designed at Month 0 and Month 3. Results: From April 2013 to June 2015, a total number of 126 patients from hematology division of 28 hospitals in China were enrolled. Of these, 116 were included in the full analysis set (FAS), including 69 patients with CML‐CP, 22 patients with CML‐AP and 25 patients with CML‐BP. Patients in the FAS had a median age of 43 years. 60.34% (70/116) were male. ECOG performance status (PS) at diagnosis was available for 81.90% (21/116) patients and most of them (75.00%, 87/116) had a good PS (PS0‐PS1). Median disease duration was 33.00 months (Q1‐Q3:14.00‐71.50). 37.38% (40/116) of the patients had received imatinib treatment for > 24 months. 75% (87/116) of the patients used dasatinib due to primary or secondary imatinib resistance and 25% (29/116) due to imatinib intolerance. 69 of 116 patients had undergone genetic mutation test at baseline, among which, 76.80% (53/69) were detected with genetic mutations. Y253F/H (15.94%; 11/69), E255K/V (11.59%; 8/69) and F359V/I (10.14%; 7/69) were the three most common mutation types, which also happened to be the mutations associated with nilotinib‐resistance. 18.97% (22/116) patients had baseline comorbidities and 50% (11/22) of them had >2 comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (CVD)/metabolic syndrome (MS) (54.54%, 12/22). It is also important to note that 22.72% (5/22) patients had a history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. For 62 CML‐CP patients who completed the second visit, 64.52% (40/62) had taken routine blood test, 72.58% (45/62) had taken PCR test and 22.58% (14/62) had taken cytogenetic test. It is noteworthy that there were still 19.35% (12/62) patients who took none of the laboratory tests mentioned above. The efficacy of dasatinib is being assessed based on the test results and will be reported in the further. Conclusion: The results from this analysis provided real‐world data about baseline characteristics and response monitoring pattern of Chinese CML patients treated with dasatinib. Although less than 20% patients had baseline comorbidities, the fact that the most common comorbidity was CVD/MS should raise awareness, because TKI‐related vascular AEs (VAEs) may develop preferentially in patients with these preexisting risk factors. Although the frequency of VAEs is lower in patients receiving dasatinib compared with nilotinib or ponatinib, for these patients, it is still important to closely monitor metabolic and cardiovascular parameters during the follow‐up to reduce the vascular risk. Meanwhile, for patients who are carriers of HBV, EMA recently recommended that signs and symptoms of active HBV infection should be closely monitored throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy, given the risk of HBV reactivation for all TKIs. Besides, patient adherence to monitoring is a concerning problem for CML management in China. This data indicates a considerable amount of CML patients, who do not follow current recommended guidelines on response monitoring.

AB: Background: While acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the disease of the elderly, treatment options has been limited for elderly patients. Decitabine is widely accepted as the treatment options for them. However, the efficacy has yet been evaluated in Asian population where difference of clinical manifestation or cytogenetics had been noted Aims: In the current study, we conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis on elderly AML patients from 8 tertiary institutes in Korea who were treated with decitabine in order to confirm whether the clinical outcomes of this agent are also acceptable in this population, and to provide further understanding of the disease nature of AML arisen in elderly patients. Methods: Patients diagnosed with AML from 2013 to 2016 were included in the analysis. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 65 or older patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed AML (myeloid blast >=20% either in the bone marrow or peripheral blood); (2) Treated with decitabine in a schedule of 20mg/m2 for five days every 4 weeks in patients. The primary end‐point of the study was OS. We compared our data to the data from another Korean retrospective analysis, in which elderly patients with AML were treated with best supportive care or intensive chemotherapy. (Int J Hematol 2014; 100: 141‐151). Results: A total of 80 patients were eligible for the analysis. The median age of patients was 74 years (range, 64 to 86 years) and 49 patients (61.3%) were male. Regarding the risk group, 6 (7.5%), 49 (61.2%), and 25 (31.3%) cases were classified as favorable, intermediate, and poor risk group, respectively. The patients had received median 3 (range 1‐27) cycles of treatment and the median OS for all patients was 10.2 months. The median OS durations according to the cytogenetic risk group are as follows; 12.4 months (95% CI 11.4‐13.4) for favorable risk group (N=6), 13.6 months (95% CI 8.7‐18.5) for intermediate risk group (N=49), and 5.5 months (95% CI 1.4‐9.6) for poor risk group (N=25) (p=.001). And when we categorized our cohort into two groups, that is ECOG‐PS 0~2 vs. ECOG‐PS 3 & 4, those with good performance status demonstrated improved survival (11.5 months (95% CI 6.6‐16.4) vs 4.4 months (95% CI 2.4‐6.4), p=.004). The OS curves according to prognostic factors are provided in figure 1. Next, we compared our data to another Korean retrospective analysis dealing with elderly AML patients who were treated with either best supportive care or intensive treatment. Although our cohort contains more patients with poor performance status and elderly patients, it seems that outcomes of decitabine treatment are fairly better than that of best supportive care (OS 3 months) and comparable to intensive chemotherapy (12.1 months). (Figure Presented) Summary/Conclusions: While the treatment options for elder AML patients have been limited, our real world data suggest that decitabine could be an effective treatment of choice also in Asia.

AB: Background/Purpose: The efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) abatacept in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been demonstrated in numerous controlled clinical trials. However, real‐world data of SC abatacept in routine care are scarce. The aim of this interim analysis is to compare the effectiveness and safety of SC abatacept used as first line or second biologic agent in Canadian patients enrolled thus far in Abatacept Best Care (ABC). Methods: ABC is a prospective, multicenter, randomized study aimed at comparing a T2T approach vs. standard of care in real‐life management of patients with RA starting SC abatacept as first line or second line biologic agent, and describing the adherence of physicians to the recommended T2T treatment guidelines while collecting data on the reallife use of SC abatacept. General linear models were used to assess the impact of prior biologic use on treatment effectiveness. Results: 276 patients (74.3% females) were included with a mean (SD) age of 59.7 (11.7) years and duration since RA diagnosis of 7.5 (8.9) years; of these 214 (77.5%) and 189 (68.5%) had available follow‐up data at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Prior biologic use was reported for 39.5% while 60.5% were biologic‐naive. Overall, baseline disease parameters were comparable with the exception of time since RA diagnosis (9.0 vs. 6.4 years; P<0.001) which was significantly higher in biologic experienced patients and TJC28 (10.5 vs. 9.1; P=0.062) which was numerically higher. After 6 months of treatment, both patient groups experienced significant improvements in all disease parameters which were maintained or further enhanced by 12 months. However, upon adjusting for baseline disease activity, improvements in CDAI (P=0.020), physician global (P=0.011), TJC28 (P=0.031), SJC28 (P=0.009), and HAQ (P=0.037) at 6 months were significantly higher in biologic‐naive patients (Table 1). Similar results were obtained at 12 months. A total of 533 AEs were reported for 162 (58.7%) patients, 67.0% of biologic‐experienced patients and 53.3% of biologic‐naïve patients (256.1 vs. 211.2 events/100 PY). The most common AEs were upper respiratory infections (biologic‐experienced vs. biologic‐naive: 4.6% vs. 9.0%; 5.2 vs. 14.6 events/100 PY) and bronchitis (7.3% vs. 7.8%; 8.4 vs. 10.2 events/100 PY). Serious AEs and serious infections were reported for 26 (9.4%) patients (10.1% vs. 9.0%; 16.8 vs. 13.2 events per 100/PY) and 5 (1.8%) patients (0.9% vs. 2.4%; 0 vs. 1.5 events/100 PY), respectively. Conclusion: The results of the current analysis suggest that SC abatacept has similar safety in biologic‐naïve and ‐ experienced patients with more improvement in outcome measures in the former.

AB: Introduction Constipation‐predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS‐C) is a common and difficult disorder to manage. Linaclotide is licensed in the UK for symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS‐C. Data from randomised, controlled trials demonstrate that the drug improves symptoms in patients with IBS‐C, but real‐world data are lacking. Methods We treated adult patients with IBS‐C (Rome III Criteria), attending outpatient clinics in three UK hospitals, with linaclotide 290 mcg once daily. IBS symptoms were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after commencing therapy using the validated IBS symptom severity scale (IBS‐SSS). Responders were defined as those patients with a decrease in total IBS‐SSS score of >75. Results A total of 108 patients (mean age 43.2; range 17‐84 years; 94 (87.0%) female) received linaclotide. In total, 4 week IBS‐SSS scores were available for 72 (66.7%) patients, and 12 weeks scores in 26 (24.1%) patients. Effect of linaclotide on individual components of the IBS‐SSS, as well as total IBS‐SSS score, at 4 and 12 weeks are detailed in Table 1. There were 49 (45.4%) patients who responded to linaclotide, with a reduction in IBS‐SSS of >75 at 4 weeks. The drug also led to a significant reduction in straining (3.9 at baseline vs. 2.0 at 4 weeks, P < 0.001), and increase in mean number of stools per week (3.8 at baseline vs. 8.9 at 4 weeks, P < 0.001). At 4 weeks, 61 (56.5%) patients continued the drug and 47 (43.5%) discontinued, 24 (22.2%) due to lack of efficacy or losses to follow‐up, and 23 (21.3%) due to adverse events (AEs). Among the 61 patients continuing linaclotide, 22 (36.1%) were responders at 12 weeks. AEs occurred in 43 (39.8%) patients overall, which lead to discontinuation of the drug in 23 (21.3%) patients either before or at their 4 week assessment. These included diarrhoea in 28 (25.9%) (15 discontinued), abdominal pain in 6 (5.6%) (5 discontinued), nausea in 3 (2.8%) (1 discontinued), flatulence in 2 (1 discontinued), headaches in 2 (0 discontinued), faecal incontinence in 1 (1 discontinued), and urgency in 1 (0 discontinued). Conclusion Linaclotide was effective in IBS‐C patients in a real‐world setting, with significant reductions in IBS‐SSS scores and straining, and a significant increase in mean number of stools per week. Responder rates at 4 and 12 weeks were 45% and 36% respectively. 40% of patients reported AEs, with diarrhoea the commonest, occurring in 26% of patients. Previous literature has reported a lower frequency of AEs, which infrequently led to withdrawal of linaclotide. However, in our study the occurrence of AEs led to discontinuation in 21% of patients.

AB: Background: Randomized placebo‐controlled trials in the development of disease‐modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease are typically of short duration (12‐18 months), and health economic modeling requires extrapolation of treatment effects beyond the trial period. Objective(s): To investigate whether observational data can be used to extrapolate data from open‐label trials, we compared outcomes (cognition, function, behavior) over 36 months for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia in the GERAS observational study (proxy for placebo control) with those of the mild Alzheimer's disease population on active treatment (solanezumab) in two 18‐month randomized placebo‐controlled trials (EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2) and the additional 18‐month open‐label extension study (EXPEDITION‐EXT). Design & Setting: Analysis of longitudinal data from patients with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia in the GERAS observational study (conducted in France, Germany and the United Kingdom) and the EXPEDITION program (conducted in Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia). Participant(s): European and North American community‐living patients, aged >=55 years, with probable Alzheimer's disease dementia and their caregivers. Mild Alzheimer's disease dementia was defined as a Mini‐Mental State Examination score of 20‐26 in EXPEDITION and 21‐26 in GERAS. Intervention(s): Active treatment in both randomized placebo‐controlled trials and the open‐label extension study was intravenous solanezumab 400 mg every 4 weeks. Patients in GERAS were receiving treatment as part of standard care. Measurements: Between‐group differences for changes from baseline over 36 months in cognitive function, ability to perform activities of daily living, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia were assessed using models stratified by propensity score. Result(s): At baseline, patients and caregivers participating in GERAS were significantly older than those in the EXPEDITION studies, and the GERAS patient cohort had fewer years of education and a shorter time since diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The baseline mean Mini‐Mental State Examination score of the GERAS cohort was significantly higher (indicating better cognition) than that of patients receiving placebo or active treatment in the pooled EXPEDITION studies Baseline functional ability scores were significantly lower for the GERAS cohort, indicating poorer functioning. Propensity score stratification achieved a good balance in the baseline variables between GERAS and the two EXPEDITION arms. Over 18 months, least squares mean changes from baseline in outcome measures were similar in the GERAS cohort and the pooled placebo groups from the randomized controlled trials. Also, the 18‐month results for the comparison between the GERAS cohort and the pooled active treatment groups from the randomized controlled trials were generally similar to those reported for the comparison with the control group in the randomized trial. Comparison of active treatment (EXPEDITION‐EXT) and observational study (GERAS, as proxy control) results over 36 months of the open‐label trial showed a significantly smaller decline in activities of daily living (instrumental and basic) in the active treatment group, reflecting better functioning, but no between‐group differences at 36 months for cognitive function or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Conclusion(s): Comparing results from clinical trials and observational studies (real‐world data) may be a useful methodological approach for informing long‐term outcomes in Alzheimer's disease drug development and could be used to inform health economic modeling. Further research using this methodological approach is needed. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB: Background/Aim: DAA regimens have been increasingly used over the last two years, since they were shown to be very effective and safe in several phase III trials. However, real‐world data are relatively limited coming from few countries. In this ongoing multicenter cohort study involving most of the Greek tertiary liver centers, we assessed the efficacy and safety of the currently recommended DAA regimens in the treatment of CHC patients (pts). Methods: We included all CHC pts who have been treated with the currently recommended by AASLD DAA regimens in 11 liver centers throughout Greece. Pts fulfilled the national criteria for treatment reimbursement with DAA [F3 experienced, F4, decompensated cirrhosis (Ci), liver transplantation, severe extrahepatic manifestation]. Efficacy was estimated by SVR12 and SAEs were reported for all pts who received .1 drug dose. Results: In total, 603 patients (males:58%, age 57+/‐11 years, BMI 27+/‐15 kg/m2) were included (GT1a: 11%, GT1b: 35%, GT2: 5%, GT3: 24%, GT4: 24%, GT5: 1%). The severity of liver disease was F0‐F2 in 5%, F3 in 21%, F4 in 64% and decompensated Ci in 10% of pts. Most pts (67%) were treatment‐experienced [(peg)IFNa+/‐RBV: 72%, peg‐IFNa+RBV+BOC/TPV 15%, SOF based regimens 13%]. SOF+SMV+/‐RBV, SOF+DCV+/‐RBV, SOF/LDV+/‐RBV or 3D+/‐RBV were given in GT1, SOF+RBV+/‐pegIFNa or SOF+DCV+/‐ RBV in GT2/3, SOF+RBV+/‐pegIFNa, SOF+SMV+/‐RBV, SOF+DCV+/‐RBV, SOF/LDV+/‐RBV or 2D+RBV in GT4 and SOF(/ LDV)+RBV in GT5 pts. At the time of analysis, SVR12 data were available for 410 (68%) pts. SVR was achieved in 362 (88%) pts and was lower in GT3 (70/79 or 79%) than non‐GT3 cases (292/321 or 91%, P=0.003) and in those with decompensated cirrhosis (34/45 or 76%) than with F4 (232/261 or 89%) or F0‐3 fibrosis (96/104 or 92%) (P=0.012). SVR rates were not affected by the DAA regimen or therapy duration (12 vs 24 weeks). Logistic regression analysis showed that lower SVR rate was independently associated with GT3 (OR:0.34, 95% CI:0.14‐0.84; P=0.019), decompensated Ci (OR:0.33, 95% CI:0.14‐0.78; P=0.012) and treatment with SOF+RBV (OR=0.29, 95% CI:0.09‐0.95; P=0.041), but not with therapy duration. SAEs of any type were observed more frequently with pegIFNa+RBV+SOF (14%) and in pts with decompensated Ci (15%) than in those with F0‐F4 CHC treated with IFNa free regimens (3.5%) (P<0.001). DAA therapy was discontinued early in 1.6% of pts. Conclusions: In our real‐world cohort including mostly treatment experienced CHC pts with advanced liver disease, almost all currently recommended DAA regimens were safe and effective offering high (>90%) SVR rates in all pts except those with GT3 and/or decompensated Ci who require better therapeutic options.

DOI: 10.1158/15387445.SABCS18-P5-14-07
AB: Background: Women with early breast cancer routinely face a choice between breast conservation therapy and mastectomy, and assume agency through shared decision making. However, for women with lower socioeconomic power or education, barriers such as access to understandable information, involvement of family in decision making, and a decreased sense of autonomy inhibits this agency. To better empower this population, a simple to understand, online, self‐administered, conjoint analysis based decision aid called "Navya Patient Preference Tool" (PPT) is developed to be used outside the physician encounter. PPT is unique in its incorporation of several psychological scales that assess potential confounders of participation in shared decision making. Methodology: This is a pre‐planned analysis of the reliability and validity of the psychological scales used in all three arms of an IRB approved randomized controlled trial to assess PPT. Women with operable node negative breast cancer eligible for BCT or MRM at one of Asia's largest academic tertiary cancer centers were eligible. PPT trial consists of an initial conjoint analysis questionnaire analyzing implicit preferences for breast conservation given to the intervention arms. The following psychological scales were given to all patients regardless of randomization: Autonomy Preference Index (API), Traditional‐Egalitarian Gender Roles (TEGR), Caregiving Role, Brief Resiliency Scale (BRS), Appearances Scale, and Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). Cronbach's alpha as a measure of internal reliability for all scales, and correlations of scores with known demographic trends as a measure of external validity are calculated. Results: Of the 102 patients enrolled, 30 completed PPT in English, 39 in Hindi, and 33 in Marathi, (vernaculars). 69/102 were in middle and lower socioeconomic groups (Kuppuswamy Index). 53/102 had completed less than high school education. Internal reliability of all scales were high, with Cronbach's alpha above 0.7: API 0.74, TEGR 0.78, Caregiving 0.7, BRS 0.7, Appearance 0.84. DCS was highly reliable at 0.91, and is the primary outcome measure for the RCT. Correlations in the dataset met those expected in real world data, suggesting external validity. For e.g., education was inversely correlated with traditional gender roles on TEGR (R‐0.4, p <0.01), and positively correlated with resilience on BRS (R 0.228, p <0.05). Individual scale items that are unrealistic were not chosen by any of the 102 respondents (e.g.,. My doctor should not participate in my medical decisions), substantiating nuanced reading. 85% of patients "Strongly Agreed" on a 1‐5 Likert scale that "The survey questions were easy to understand" (mean score 1.18/5. SD 0.4). Conclusions: Women with limited education and low socioeconomic status complete the online, self administered PPT outside of a physician encounter, with high internal reliability and external validity. Decision Aids such as Navya PPT, which account for psychosocial confounders of agency, have the potential to benefit women otherwise marginalized from shared decision making.

TI: Mobile Technology & Online Tools to Track Adherence in Chronic Illness Patients

YR: 2016
KY: Chronic Disease; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1
AB: Advances in medical treatment options over the past several decades have translated into substantially higher survival rates for those who suffer with chronic illness. Consequently, the prevalence of chronic illness has risen significantly in recent years, such that one out of every four youth in the United States currently lives with a chronic illness. The health and well‐being of these youth is directly impacted by the degree to which they adhere to their treatment regimen. However, treatment regimens for chronic illness can be highly complex, making adherence problematic, particularly when combined with deficits in memory and executive functioning concomitant with many chronic illnesses. Adherence also tends to deteriorate over time; the youth's motivation or commitment to treatment may decline as symptoms improve or negative side effects occur. With low adherence comes worsening symptoms and significantly greater risk for serious medical complications and mortality in young adulthood. The costs associated with low adherence, such as the need for additional care, are also substantial both for the patient and society. While a number of factors have been found to impact treatment adherence, risk for non‐adherence—across varied forms of chronic illness—is markedly elevated when the youth lacks disease‐ and treatment‐related knowledge and when parents provide little supervision for carrying out regimen tasks. With nearly 90% of youth with chronic illness expected to survive and therefore transition from pediatric care into adult‐focused healthcare systems, it is critically important to empower youth to take ownership of their own healthcare. To do so, we need to provide accessible, affordable tools that can effectively increase patients' skills and knowledge for managing their illness and support on‐going adherence to their treatment regimen. The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of Planet T1D, a mobile and web‐based technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths' type 1 diabetes disease‐ and treatment‐related knowledge through interactive and game‐based educational materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via mobile and web‐based delivery; and (c) promote patient‐provider communication through real‐world data collection and feedback loops. Investigators will examine the effectiveness of the Planet T1D mobile app and website in improving treatment adherence, disease‐related knowledge, transition readiness, condition management, and the psychological correlates of these variables in youth with type 1 diabetes. All participants will complete study measures at pre‐ and post‐assessment time points. In total, participants will take part in this study for approximately 2 months from pre‐ to post‐assessment. Families will be recruited to participate in either the treatment condition or the control group. Families in the treatment condition will receive the Planet T1D app and access to the associated website for the full duration of the study (2 months) between pre‐test and post‐test. Families in the control group will not receive access to the app and website, but instead will be asked to complete a series of online questionnaires at each of the two data collection time points (pre‐test, post‐test). Investigators hypothesize that greater use (i.e., dosage) and prolonged use of Planet T1D and access to the associated website will: increase disease‐related knowledge, treatment adherence, self‐efficacy for management of type 1 diabetes, current type 1 diabetes self‐management behaviors, readiness to transition to independent self‐care, and perceived benefits of type 1 diabetes treatment, while also decreasing perceived barriers to type 1 diabetes treatment. Moreover, investigators believe that improvement of these outcomes through use of Planet T1D will result in more positive mental health outcomes for patients, including higher reported quality of life. Investigators expect that those in the treatment condition will have better outcomes than those in the control group on all of these measures at both midpoint and post‐assessment time points. Finally, investigators expect all participants to report high usability, quality, and value of the Planet T1D mobile app and website and to positively rate their experience with Planet T1D.

AB: EXELS is an ongoing phase IV non‐interventional study; 3643 high‐risk patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) were recruited across 13 European countries. We report patient characteristics and cytoreductive treatment patterns of ET across Europe. Hydroxycarbamide (HC; 64.3%) and anagrelide (22.0%) were the two main cytoreductive treatments prescribed. The proportions of patients taking either HC or anagrelide varied across countries, as did the number of patients receiving anti‐aggregatory therapy in addition to cytoreductive treatment. This real‐world evidence demonstrates that, generally, treatment patterns of ET across Europe adhere to expert recommendations, with some notable variations between countries. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB: Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia among adults in Western countries with a median age of 72 years at diagnosis. Prior to the introduction of kinase inhibitor therapies, chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) combinations, monoclonal antibody monotherapies, and chemotherapy combinations were the predominant therapy regardless of line of CLL treatment. Given the increased frequency of high‐risk features (del17p, del11q,) and prior exposure to CIT combinations, shortened disease‐free periods and increased short‐/long‐term toxicities are frequently seen in relapsed CLL setting. However, data from recent randomized clinical trials of novel agents, such as ibrutinib in the relapsed setting, have shown significant improvements in overall surviVal (OS). While we await real‐world data on how novel agents impact real‐world CLL outcomes, little is known about the management and surviVal among CLL patients prior to their aVailability, particularly in the relapse setting. Our study uses comprehensive prescription and medical insurance claims linked with registry data to describe surviVal outcomes in older adults with CLL receiving second line treatment between 2007‐2013‐an era that predates the approVals of ibrutinib, idelalisib, venetoclax and obinutuzumab. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used the 2007 to 2013 SEER‐Medicare linked database. The sample included patients with first primary tumor site as CLL or SLL (ICD‐O histology codes '9670' and '9823') diagnosed between 2007 and 2011. This date of first diagnosis of CLL or SLL defines the index date. Patients aged > 65 years with Medicare fee‐for‐service coverage in the 12 months pre‐index and Medicare fee‐for‐service and prescription drug coverage in the 6‐months post‐index period or until death were included. Second line treatment date was defined as the date a treatment was received that was not part of the initial therapy or the date where initial therapy was restarted after a 180+ day gap in treatment. Our primary study outcome was overall surviVal (OS) from the date of initiation of second line treatment. The association of patient‐level characteristics with OS was measured using cox regression analysis. Results: Of the 1047 patients who received any CLL treatment, 387 (37%) patients met the definition for receiving a second line of therapy. The mean age of this second line cohort was 76 years (SD = 6) and 48.3% were male. Only 9 patients who left fee‐for‐service Medicare during the second line follow up period were excluded from analysis. Of our 387 patient cohort, 25.3% (n=98) received fludarabine as part of their initial treatment, with remaining 74.7% (n=289) receiving a non‐fludarabine containing initial therapy. The median time from CLL diagnosis date to second treatment was 664 days (Q1‐Q3 390‐1159 days). Rituximab containing regimens were the most common second line treatment (n=276, 71.3% of patients), with 118 patients (30.5%) in our second line cohort receiving rituximab monotherapy. Another 35 (9%) patients received chlorambucil monotherapy and the remaining 76 (19.6%) patients received a non‐rituximab mono‐or combination chemotherapy as their second line treatment. The median follow‐up time in the sample from second line treatment was 14.9 months. Median OS for the cohort from initiation of their second line of treatment was 34.3 months, with 72% OS at 1‐year and 58% at 2‐years (See Figure). MultiVariate Cox regression modeling showed OS from second line of treatment was associated with year of CLL diagnosis (2011 vs. 2007, HR 2.2; p=0.02), higher age at time of treatment (70‐74 vs 80+, HR 0.67; P=0.04), male gender (HR 1.5; P=0.01), Northeast census region (vs West, HR 1.7; P=0.01), and initial treatment that included fludarabine (HR 1.5; P=0.04). Conclusions: In our real world analysis, over one‐third of the newly diagnosed CLL patients who received treatment progressed to second line therapy. We found poor surviVal in these older adults following initiation of second line CLL therapy treated in the pre‐kinase/BCL‐2 inhibitor era with about half who died within two years of initiating second line therapy. While aVailable clinical trials suggest novel CLL agents offer significant improvements in OS in relapsed CLL, future studies should examine real world CLL outcomes to correlate how results obtained in recent landmark clinical trials translate into clinical practice.

AB: Introduction. The outlook for myeloma patients who relapse after or become refractory to bortezomib and IMiDs is poor, with limited therapeutic options and a median survival (OS) of 9 months. In the phase 3 MM‐003 study, pomalidomide plus low‐dose dexamethasone resulted in a significant PFS (median 4 vs 1.9 months) and OS (median 1 3.1 vs 8.1 months) benefit, compared to high‐dose dexamethasone. Information on real‐world outcomes of pomalidomide therapy is limited. We carried out a retrospective analysis of patients receiving pomalidomide in the UK, to compare outcomes and tolerability with published clinical trial data, and focus on high risk subgroups. Methods. All patients treated with pomalidomide at 5 major UK centres between August 201 3 and March 2016 were identified from chemotherapy records, and clinical data including toxicity and survival from patient records. Disease response and adverse FISH were defined as per IMWG. Survival was estimated using Kaplan‐Meier, and correlations made using log‐rank methods. Key subgroups: eGFR <45ml/min, adverse genetics, and older age were assessed. Results. A total of 85 patients were identified. Of these, 70 (82%) had measurable disease (IMWG criteria) and received >1 cycle so were included in response analyses. Baseline patient characteristics are reported in Table 1. 96.5% of patients were refractory to one or more IMiDs, and 72.9% were refractory to both IMiDs and bortezomib. 92.9% were refractory to their last treatment. The median dose of pomalidomide was 4mg (2‐4). Grade 3‐4 non‐haematological toxicities occurred in 42.4%: pneumonia (16.5%), neutropenic sepsis (8.2%), and acute kidney injury (7.1%), were most common. Grade 3‐4 neutropenia occurred in 38% and thrombocytopenia in 24%. Seven patients died on treatment, 6 during the first cycle (2 PD and sepsis, 2 neutropenic sepsis, 1 PD and AKI, 2 pneumonia). In the 70 patients assessable for response, ORR was 52.9% (5.7% VGPR, 47.1% PR, 38.6% SD). Median duration of response (DoR) was 4 months. With median follow‐up of 13 months, median PFS was 5 months (95%CI 3.6‐6.4), and median OS 13 months (95%CI 10.8‐15.2). Patients with renal failure (eGFR <45ml/min) had PFS and OS that were similar to those with eGFR >45ml/min ((HR=0.95, 95%CI 0.49‐1.82, and HR=1.22, 0.59‐2.53). Patients with adverse FISH (44%) had similar outcomes to those with standard FISH (ORR 45.8 vs 50%, median PFS 6 vs 5 months (HR=0.86, 95%CI 0.44‐1.67, and median OS 10 vs 8 months, HR=1.223, 0.55‐2.68). Patients aged >65yrs had similar outcomes to younger patients, (ORR 54.1 vs 51.5%, median PFS and OS comparable between groups). Rates of toxicity were also not influenced by renal impairment, adverse genetics, or older age. The most important predictors of PFS and OS were depth and durability of response. PFS was 6 months for patients achieving PR, 4 months for SD and 1 month for PD, while OS was 18 months in patients achieving PR, 13 months for SD and 3 months for PD. For patients with DoR >4 months, PFS was 11 months and OS 23 months. In contrast, in patients whose DoR was < 4 months or who did not respond, OS was 9 months. Conclusions. Our real‐world data on the characteristics and outcomes of patients receiving pomalidomide for relapsed/refractory myeloma in the UK reflect results of published clinical trials. The ORR of 52.9% in our cohort is higher than in MM‐003 and MM‐010, but PFS (5 months) and OS (13 months) were remarkably similar. Rates of haematological toxicity and infections are low, confirming the good tolerability of pomalidomide in this patient group. Depth and sustainability of response were important predictors of survival: achievement of PR was associated with improved PFS and OS, while patients who achieved SD still derived a survival benefit. Patients who maintained a response for at least 4 months had an estimated survival of nearly 2 years. No difference in response, survival or tolerability was seen in key subgroups, including those with moderate renal impairment, adverse cytogenetics and older age. Our findings confirm the efficacy of pomalidomide in these heavily pre‐treated patients and add to the evidence for the benefit of pomalidomide in high risk patient groups.

KY: Papillomavirus Infections; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaccines
AB: Cervical cancer and other HPV‐associated cancers comprise an important public health burden worldwide, with over 600,000 HPV‐associated cancers diagnosed each year. Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination with three doses of commercially available vaccines, the regimen currently approved by the FDA, is highly efficacious in preventing targeted carcinogenic HPV infections and related cervical cancer precursors. In some regions of the world, two‐dose vaccination schedules for adolescents have started to be recommended, based on immunobridging studies demonstrating immunologic non‐inferiority of two doses in that age group, compared with three doses of the vaccine in the adult women in the phase III efficacy trials. Still, the majority of women who are at the greatest lifetime risk for cervical cancer are not being vaccinated because cost and logistical considerations for administering multi‐dose vaccine programs continue to impede progress in reducing this preventable cancer. The NCI‐sponsored Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) and the commercially‐sponsored Papilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA Trial), both of which tested the bivalent HPV vaccine, showed similar vaccine efficacy over four years among women who received one, two and three doses of the HPV16/18 vaccine, and stable antibody responses have been observed throughout the seven years of follow‐up accrued to date in CVT, suggesting durability of responses. Additionally, 36‐month preliminary analysis of a large, post‐licensure trial of the quadrivalent vaccine in India showed similar protection against HPV16/18 cervical infection whether the women received one dose, two doses, or three doses. However, vaccine recipients in these trials were not randomized to receive these fewer doses, and immunogenicity among one‐dose recipients was lower than that observed following two‐ or three‐doses, leading regulatory bodies to conclude that the level of evidence in support of single‐dose HPV vaccination is insufficient to warrant changes in current recommendations for two‐ or three‐ dose schedules. A study of the minimum number of doses needed to confer durable protection could provide seminal evidence to justify changing the current vaccine recommendation from two to one dose for adolescents. Therefore, we are proposing to conduct a trial in Costa Rica to formally evaluate one‐ and two‐dose vaccination, and to estimate the public health benefit of one‐ and two‐dose schedules versus none. More specifically, we will conduct a four‐arm trial of 20,000 12‐to‐16‐year‐old girls randomized, in two stages, to receive one or two doses of the Merck nonavalent (Gardasil‐9) or GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals bivalent (Cervarix) HPV vaccines and to be followed initially for four years, to formally evaluate the non‐inferiority of one versus two doses of each of these two vaccines. This trial will be complemented by an epidemiological HPV survey (followed by vaccination) to estimate the public health benefit of reduced‐dosage vaccination versus none. As a primary endpoint, we will focus on the prevention of new, persistent infection by HPV types 16 and 18, because they account for the largest public health burden. The trial will also evaluate protection against the other cancer‐ and genital wart‐causing HPV types, while documenting infection by non‐vaccine HPV types to verify continued exposure among trial participants. In addition to the evaluation of efficacy against HPV infection, we propose to monitor participants immunological response to vaccination, to demonstrate robust, stable, and durable antibody responses following one‐ and two‐dose vaccination, and to enable studies to compare immune responses induced by the two vaccines, which contain different adjuvants. This effort will establish the foundation for immunobridging studies that could accelerate future vaccine development. We envision that these immunobridging studies could bridge our study to different populations and age groups and/or to next‐generation vaccines that are based on the same virus‐like particle technology (i.e., biosimilar vaccines). We anticipate that results from this proposed effort will provide the evidence required for global policy changes towards single‐dose vaccination programs, if non‐inferiority of one‐dose is demonstrated, and lead to a better understanding of antibody levels required for protection. If one‐dose protection is observed in these first four years, follow‐up might need to be extended by at least six years to assess durability of the response to vaccination. If one dose of either vaccine is found to be inferior to two doses, our study will also provide estimates of the impact of single dose vaccination versus none, so that policy makers in regions where widespread vaccination programs have yet to be implemented can consider the decrement in efficacy of one versus two dose vaccination in light of the estimated public health impact of a single‐dose program. Finally, the proposed work holds the potential to transform current approaches to vaccine development, as it could provide the first example of a single dose (prime only) subunit vaccine that induces durable and protective (sterilizing) immunity. Randomized trial data on the comparative effectiveness of alternative vaccine and dose regimens is necessary. Public health policy makers also require information on the projected cost and long‐term health outcomes associated with each vaccine regimen to make evidence‐ based decisions regarding the large‐scale implementation of sustainable, cost‐effective HPV vaccination programs. Mathematical simulation models of cervical carcinogenesis can integrate biologic, epidemiologic, economic, and behavioral data from the 1DT and other studies to project the long‐term health and economic impact of different vaccine and dose regimens and evaluate the comparative‐ and cost‐effectiveness of alternative vaccination strategies to inform public health policy. Optimal implementation policies may depend on the level and duration of efficacy for a single dose and achievable completion rates for a two‐dose regimen. Even if one‐ dose protection is found to be lower than protection associated with two or three doses, the relative costs and effects of vaccinating more individuals with one dose might yield a greater reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. We will use mathematical models to quantify the potential tradeoffs between resource utilization, simplicity of implementation and administration, and program effectiveness based on real‐world data on intervention costs and effectiveness.

AB: INTRODUCTION SUSTAIN was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 2, 52‐week study that compared the effect of crizanlizumab, a P‐selectin inhibitor, versus placebo on the frequency of sickle cell pain crises (SCPCs, or vaso‐occlusive crises [VOCs] leading to a health care visit) in patients with any genotype of sickle cell disease (SCD). Crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg significantly reduced the annual frequency of VOCs versus placebo (1.6 vs 3.0, P=0.01) and increased the time to first on‐treatment VOC (4.1 vs 1.4 months, P=0.001). The current study, SUCCESSOR (SUSTAIN Chart‐review of Crizanlizumab to Evaluate Sickle‐cell Study One‐year Retrospective), reviewed medical records of patients who completed the SUSTAIN study at US sites to assess additional cases of significant pain crisis events, and to generate real‐world data on treatment patterns and health care resource utilization upon completion of treatment with crizanlizumab. METHODS SUCCESSOR is a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (=18 years old) who participated in the SUSTAIN study in the United States to evaluate outcomes related to SCD up to 52 weeks following their completion of the trial. SUCCESSOR included the per protocol population from SUSTAIN, which included the intent‐to‐treat patients who received at least 12 of the 14 planned study drug doses, completed a visit at least 14 days after the final dose of study drug, and had no major protocol violations that impacted the efficacy assessments. The overall study period for the retrospective study was from September 2015 to March 2017 and patient data were obtained from medical records. Crizanlizumab was not administered post‐SUSTAIN. Patient consent was obtained prior to data collection if required by local and/or central research ethics review. RESULTS In this preliminary analysis, a total of 6 patient data sets were extracted. These patients had been randomized to the following treatment arms in the SUSTAIN study: 1 placebo, 1 crizanlizumab 2.5 mg/kg, and 4 crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg. The patient who had received placebo during SUSTAIN was a 27‐year‐old male with HbS/β‐thalassemia SCD. The patient who had received crizanlizumab 2.5 mg/kg was a 42‐year‐old female with HbSC SCD. The patients who had received crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg were: a 28‐year‐old male with HbSS SCD; a 32‐year‐old female with HbSS SCD; a 56‐yearold female with HbSC SCD; and a 65‐year‐old female with HbSS SCD. All patients were Black or African‐American. In the 52 weeks following completion of the SUSTAIN study, patients who had received placebo or crizanlizumab 2.5 mg/kg reported 4 and 5 VOC events, respectively, while crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg patients reported 0‐2 VOC events (Table). Four patients (3 crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg, 1 placebo) reported hydroxyurea (HU) usage during and after SUSTAIN. One patient who had received crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg and did not report HU usage during SUSTAIN reported HU usage post‐SUSTAIN. All patients reported opioid usage after SUSTAIN. Transfusions were not allowed during SUSTAIN; 2 patients, 1 who had received crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg and 1 who had received placebo, reported transfusions post‐SUSTAIN. Five of the 6 patients reported utilizing health care resources (eg, clinic visits, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations) post‐SUSTAIN. One patient who received crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg did not report utilizing any health care resources post‐SUSTAIN and did not report any VOC events in the 52 weeks after SUSTAIN. We report our initial results from a limited number of patients from SUCCESSOR and therefore summarized post‐SUSTAIN outcomes without analysis. In 5 of the 6 patients, the annual frequency of VOC events remained the same or increased in the post‐SUSTAIN period compared to that during the SUSTAIN study. Data collection is ongoing in additional eligible patients. Disclosures Shah: Novartis: Consultancy, Research Funding, Speakers Bureau.

AB: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and it leads to significant morbidity and mortality, predominantly from ischemic stroke. Vitamin K antagonists, mainly warfarin, have been used for decades to prevent ischemic stroke in AF, but their use is limited due to interactions with food and other drugs, as well as the requirement for regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio. Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor and the most commonly used non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulant, avoids many of these challenges and is being prescribed with increasing frequency for stroke prevention in non‐valvular AF. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) data from the ROCKET‐AF(Rivaroxaban once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial fibrillation) trial have shown rivaroxaban to be non‐inferior to warfarin in preventing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism and to have comparable overall bleeding rates. Applicability of the RCT data to real‐world practice can sometimes be limited by complex clinical scenarios or multiple comorbidities not adequately represented in the trials. Available real‐world evidence in non‐valvular AF patients with comorbidities ‐ including renal impairment, acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, or old age ‐ supports the use of rivaroxaban as safe and effective in preventing ischemic stroke in these subgroups, though with some important considerations required to reduce bleeding risk. Patient perspectives on rivaroxaban use are also considered. Real‐world evidence indicates superior rates of drug adherence with rivaroxaban when compared with vitamin K antagonists and with alternative non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants ‐ perhaps, in part, due to its once‐daily dosing regimen. Furthermore, self‐reported quality of life scores are highest among patients compliant with rivaroxaban therapy. The generally high levels of patient satisfaction with rivaroxaban therapy contribute to overall favorable clinical outcomes.

AB: Randomized clinical trials often serve the purpose of assessing the efficacy and safety of a compound. By combining real‐world evidence and randomization, pragmatic randomized clinical trials (PrCTs) can be used to inform treatment effectiveness and healthcare decisions. PrCTs, referring to studies where several pragmatic elements are used (eligibility, endpoints, follow‐up, etc.), pose unique challenges (Loudon et al. in BMJ 350:h2147, 2015). From a literature review, we propose a definition of PrCT and discuss strategies to overcome some PrCT challenges. Use of alternative data collection approaches may lead to uncertainties, and absence of blinding could potentially lead to non‐random missing data at study endpoints such that randomization is no longer protected by an intent to treat. Therefore, more complex randomization strategies may be needed to minimize bias. Additional data sources could be used to synthesize information and create a more accurate endpoint definition, which may require tools such as natural language processing. The statistician must become familiar with the challenges and strengths of PrCTs, ranging from design to analysis to interpretation, in order to transform data into evidence (Califf in Clin Trials 13:471–477, 2016).

AB: BACKGROUND: Evidence from clinical trials supports the use of alefacept for the treatment of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, either as monotherapy or combined with other treatment modalities. OBJECTIVE: AWARE (Amevive Wisdom Acquired from Real‐World Evidence) is a multicenter, observational, phase IV Canadian registry of psoriasis patients treated with alefacept. METHODS: Patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were treated with at least one course of alefacept treatment followed by a period of at least 12 weeks off‐treatment. The use of combination therapy with alefacept in a real‐world population of psoriasis patients is presented here, including the types of psoriasis therapies received by patients at the time of enrolment, reasons for initiating alefacept, and discontinuation or dosage reduction of concomitant therapy. RESULTS: The majority of patients were receiving other antipsoriatic therapies at the time of enrolment into the AWARE study, most commonly topical therapy, systemic agents, or phototherapy. Most patients were receiving monotherapy prior to the initiation of alefacept. There was little change in the use of topical therapies with alefacept at 24 weeks, whereas a substantial proportion of patients were able to reduce or discontinue concomitant systemic therapies and/or phototherapy. The use of combination therapy regimens was relatively consistent across the country and by age groups, although younger patients were prescribed systemic agents more often than older patients. CONCLUSION: Alefacept is commonly added to other antipsoriatic therapies in a broad population of real‐world chronic plaque psoriasis patients in Canada and may allow for dosage reduction or discontinuation of concomitant systemic agents or phototherapy.

AB: Aim: The REDUCCTION Partnership aims to 1) Define and standardize reporting of bacteraemia resulting from central venous dialysis catheters in Australia and New Zealand; 2) Reduce the rate of rate of dialysis catheter related bacteraemia. Background: Data on the true extent of variation in care in catheter use is not well known due to the absence of any routine standardized data collection. Methods: The REDUCCTION Project is a national evidence implementation study using a stepped‐wedge, cluster trial design. The randomization will occur at the level of the treating unit. There will be an initial period in which no clusters will be exposed to the interventions. At regular intervals, one cluster (up to 10 units) will be randomized to receive the intervention. This process will continue until all renal units are receiving the intervention. Each unit will contribute data to before and after the intervention observation period. Results: This will be the first implementation of such a methodology within Australian nephrology. We intend to randomize in three tranches over a 12month period. We have currently recruited 27 renal units into the project. These units encompass the states of NSW (7 units), Victoria (6 units), Queensland (5 units), Western Australia (3 units), South Australia (2 units), Tasmania (1 units) and the Northern Territory (2 units). Conclusions: This project will demonstrate the capability of the stepped‐wedge cluster trial design for use in a real world evidence implementation setting. It will allow assessment of the success of a nationwide evidence implementation project.

AB: Introduction: To test the hypothesis, using real world evidence that increasing protein delivery and decreasing carbohydrates (CHO) may improve clinical outcomes. Methods: Retrospective analysis of existing electronic medical records (EMR) of patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) at the Geisinger Health System. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine correlation between protein delivered (which was proportional to the concentration of protein in the formula utilized) and clinical outcomes. Results: 2000 medical encounters for a total number of 12,321 ICU days were collected and analyzed. Average age was 62.2 years (55.2% male) and 68.1% were obese and overweight. Primary diagnoses included sepsis or septic shock, acute and/or chronic respiratory failure (or illness), cardiovascular diseases, stroke and cerebrovascular diseases among others. Median hospital LOS was 13.6 days, 6.9 days in the ICU, median days of invasive mechanical ventilation of 4. 30‐day readmission rate among patients discharged alive was 19.3%. Patients in the High protein group received lower amounts of CHOs (data not shown). Unadjusted 30‐day post‐discharge mortality was inversely proportional to the amount of protein delivered (Table 1). Conclusions: A significant improvement in mortality is observed with increased protein delivery while decreasing carbohydrate loads. Prospective randomized trials are warranted to establish causality.

AB: The GetReal consortium of the Innovative Medicines Initiative aims to develop strategies to incorporate real‐world evidence earlier into the drug life cycle to better inform health care decision makers on the comparative risks and benefits of new drugs. Pragmatic trials are currently explored as a means to generate such evidence in routine care settings. The traditional informed consent model for randomized clinical trials has been argued to pose substantial hurdles to the practicability of pragmatic trials: it would lead to recruitment difficulties, reduced generalizability of the results, and selection bias. The present article analyzes these challenges and discusses four proposed alternative informed consent models: integrated consent, targeted consent, broadcast consent, and a waiver of consent. These alternative consent models each aim at overcoming operational and methodological challenges, while still providing patients all the relevant information they need to make informed decisions. Each consent model, however, relies on different attitudes toward the principle of respect for persons and the related duty to inform patients as well as represents different views on whether the common good demands moral duties from patients. Such normative consequences of modifying consent requirements should be at least acknowledged and ought to be assessed in light of the validity of empirical claims. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

AB: Objectives: Pragmatic trials evaluate the comparative benefits, risks, and burdens of health care interventions in real‐world conditions. Such studies are now recognized as valuable to the perimarketing stage of drug development and evaluation, with early pragmatic trials (EPTs) being explored as a means to generate real‐world evidence at the time of regulatory market approval. In this article, we present an analysis of the ethical issues involved in informed consent for EPTs, in light of the generally recognized concern that traditional ethical rules governing randomized clinical trials, such as lengthy informed consent procedures, could threaten the "real world" nature of such trials. Specifically, we examine to what extent modifications (waivers or alterations) to regulatory consent for EPTs would be ethical. Methods: We first identify broadly accepted necessary conditions for modifications of informed consent (namely, the research involves no more than minimal risk of harm, the research is impracticable with regulatory consent, and the alternative to regulatory consent does not violate legitimate patient expectations) and then apply those criteria to the premarket and early postmarket contexts. Results and Conclusions: The analysis shows that neither waivers nor alterations of regulatory consent for premarket EPTs will be ethically permissible. For postmarket EPTs with newly approved interventions, waivers of consent will be ethically problematic, but some studies might be conducted in an ethical manner with alterations to regulatory consent.

AB: Objectives: The primary objective is to prospectively study the comparative safety and effectiveness of older and newer classes of nonbiologic DMARDs (Disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs), biologic DMARDs and targeted synthetic therapies approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a real‐world patient population in Japan. Methods: Prospective, multicenter, noninterventional, observational study across geographic distribution of both private and public institutions for patients with RA who are newly prescribed one of the following medications: (1) methotrexate; (2) anti‐TNF biologic DMARDs; (3) non‐TNF biologic DMARDs; and (4) approved JAK inhibitors at the time of enrollment into the registry. Target enrollment is currently 2000 subjects. Baseline and follow‐up data on patient demographics, medical history, disease activity, laboratory results, comorbidities, hospitalizations, and targeted safety events are obtained via Physician and Patient Questionnaires. Results: Fifty sites are anticipated to participate with 40 sites ethics committee (EC) approved at the time of submission consisting of 23% clinics, 21% private academic hospitals, 29% private mid‐sized to large hospitals, 15% national academic hospitals, and 12% national hospitals. Conclusion: The Corrona Japan RA Registry will provide real‐world evidence from both private and public institutions on the comparative effectiveness and safety of recently approved RA therapies in Japan.

AB: Background: Anti‐tumor necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, because of their complexity, their production is expensive contributing to their high price. As the patent protection of these therapies has expired in several countries, biosimilars have been developed to reduce the healthcare costs. The aim of this article is to review the literature on the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of biosimilars in IBD. Methods: A PubMed literature search was performed using the following terms until May 2016: ‘biosimilars’, ‘CT‐P13', ‘infliximab’, ‘Crohn’s disease’, ‘ulcerative colitis’, ‘inflammatory bowel diseases’, ‘efficacy’, ‘safety’, ‘immunogenicity’. Additionally, abstracts from international meetings were also reviewed. Results: A total of eleven studies in IBD patients provided real‐world evidence on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profile of biosimilars in IBD patients. Based on the available evidence, CT‐P13 is efficacious and well tolerated in IBD patients in a real‐life setting. The vast majority of studies only included IBD patients who had never received biological therapies. Information regarding the interchangeability between CT‐P13 and its originator is currently being investigated in the NOR‐SWITCH trial. Otherwise, the immunogenicity profile of CT‐P13 seems to be similar to the originator. Conclusion: The infliximab biosimilar seems to be efficacious, safe and with a similar immunogenicity profile as the originator in IBD. Large prospective post‐marketing studies are needed to assess the long‐term safety profile of CT‐P13. The use of infliximab biosimilars may lead to major healthcare cost savings.

AB: Agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs), as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and immune checkpoint receptor programmed death 1 (PD‐1) signaling pathway have improved clinical outcomes for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) pazopanib and sunitinib are FDA‐approved first‐line treatment options for advanced RCC; however, other treatment options in this setting are available, including the recently approved combination of nivolumab (anti‐PD‐1) and ipilimumab (anti‐cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated protein‐4 [CTLA‐4]) for patients with intermediate or poor risk. Unfortunately, treatment guideline recommendations provide little guidance to aid first‐line treatment choice. In addition, several ongoing randomized phase III trials of investigational first‐line regimens may complicate the RCC treatment paradigm if these agents gain approval. This article reviews clinical trial and real‐world evidence for currently approved and investigational first‐line treatment regimens for advanced RCC and provides clinical evidence to aid first‐line treatment selection. Implications for Practice: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as first‐line treatment options for advanced renal cell carcinoma; however, the treatment paradigm is rapidly evolving. The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was recently approved for intermediate‐ and poor‐risk patients, and other combination strategies and novel first‐line agents will likely be introduced soon.

DOI: 10.1024/0301-1526/a000730
AB: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremity arteries (PAD) remains a significant burden on global healthcare systems with increasing prevalence. Various guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with PAD are available but they often lack a sufficient evidence base for high‐grade recommendations since randomized and controlled trials (RCT) remain rare or are frequently subject to conflicts of interest. This registry trial aims to evaluate the outcomes of catheter‐based endovascular revascularisations vs. open‐surgical endarterectomy vs. bypass surgery for symptomatic PAD on medical and patient‐reported outcomes. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study is a prospective non‐randomized multicentre registry trial including invasive revascularisations performed in 10 000 patients treated for symptomatic PAD at 30 to 40 German vascular centres. All patients matching the inclusion criteria are consecutively included for a recruitment period of six months (between May and December 2018) or until 10 000 patients have been included in the study registry. There are three follow‐up measures at three, six, and 12 months. Automated completeness and plausibility checks as well as independent site visit monitoring will be performed to assure high internal and external validity of the study data. Study endpoints include relevant major cardiovascular and limb events and patient‐reported outcomes from two Delphi studies with experts in vascular medicine and registry‐based research. DISCUSSION: It remains unclear if results from RCT can reflect daily treatment practice. Furthermore, great costs and complexity make it challenging to accomplish high quality randomized trials in PAD treatment. Prospective registry‐based studies to collect real‐world evidence can help to overcome these limitations.

AB: Objectives: To determine how European databases are used to support pharmacoepidemiological research. Randomised, controlled trials remain the gold standard for evaluation of drug efficacy and safety. However, the only way of identifying treatment pathways and improving understanding of real world costs and outcomes at different stages of care is via longitudinal observational studies. Observational data from electronic health records (EHRs) are essential to this pharmaco‐epidemiological research. Different European databases have different strengths in terms of data types and availability. Identifying these strengths will help to select the right database for a particular study. In this context, one approach to increasing our understanding is to analyse types of published data to determine how databases have historically been used to support research. Methods: We identified peer‐reviewed publications over the last 10 years from one popular longitudinal general practice patient database with some secondary care links. The publications were assigned to disease areas and study types (e.g. prevalence, resource utilisation, treatment patterns, outcomes etc). Results: Based on this mapping exercise, we identified the types of studies and the disease areas that this European database commonly supports. We also highlight gaps in disease area coverage and types of real world evidence studies and discuss potential reasons for this underuse. Conclusions: European observational data from EHRs provide increasingly important information for stakeholders of new treatment, however there are still a number of gaps in terms of disease areas and study types that these databases can support.

AB: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and for prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In phase III clinical trials that included more than 100,000 patients, the DOACs were at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and were associated with less serious bleeding, particularly less intracranial bleeding. Real‐world evidence supports these outcomes. Despite this, some physicians and patients are concerned about serious bleeding or emergencies unless specific reversal agents for the DOACs are available. However, in clinical trials performed without reversal agents, the outcome of major bleeds was similar or better in patients receiving DOACs than in those taking VKAs. Because of their short half‐lives, supportive measures are sufficient to manage most bleeds in patients receiving DOACs. Anticoagulant reversal should only be considered with life‐threatening bleeds, with bleeds that fail to respond to usual measures and in patients requiring urgent surgery. Idarucizumab is licensed for dabigatran reversal and andexanet alfa is likely to be soon licensed for reversal of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. To ensure responsible use of these agents, every hospital needs a bleeding management algorithm that identifies patients eligible for reversal and outlines appropriate dosing regimens.

AB: The nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), also referred to as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have emerged as effective alternatives to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) across several indications, including the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (SSE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Their use in patients with renal impairment is of particular importance, given the prevalence of renal dysfunction in the indicated populations and the impact of renal function on the metabolism of the NOACs. This publication reviews the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of the NOACs and clinical trial results for patients with renal impairment within the AF and VTE indications. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data show the NOACs are dependent on renal clearance to varying extents. Relative to VKAs, the efficacy and safety of the NOACs is preserved in patients with moderate renal impairment. The dosing recommendations for patients with renal impairment differ depending on the NOAC, whereby some of the NOACs require dose reductions based solely on renal function, while others require consideration of additional criteria. However, despite these specific dosing recommendations, emerging real‐world evidence suggests patients are not being dosed appropriately, indicating a possible knowledge gap. Adherence to recommended dosing algorithms has implications on the optimal efficacy and safety of the NOACs. To this end, renal function should be assessed in patients on a NOAC, as worsening of renal function may warrant change in the dose of a NOAC or change in oral anticoagulant.

AB: Pragmatic trials may deliver real‐world evidence on the added value of new medications compared with usual care and inform decision making earlier in development. This fifth paper in a series on pragmatic trials in the Journal discusses usual care as a comparator and the allocation of treatment strategies. The allocation and implementation of treatment strategies should resemble clinical practice as closely as possible. Randomization at the level of the site, as opposed to at the individual level, may be preferred. Data analysis according to the intention‐to‐treat principle is recommended, and crossover between treatment arms and strong treatment preferences may be accounted for in the study design in specific situations. Although usual care is the comparator of choice, this may differ substantially between centers and countries complicating comparator choice. Using clinical guidelines to define usual care can be helpful in standardizing comparator treatments; however, this may decrease the applicability of the results to real‐life settings. Conversely, using multiple usual‐care treatment arms will increase the complexity of the study. The specific objectives of the trial and design choices should be discussed with all stakeholders to realize the full potential of the pragmatic trial. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

DOI: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehs281
AB: Introduction: Adaptive servo ventilator (ASV) was developed as a device to abolish sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in heart failure patients. Recently, ASV is getting widely used for heart failure patients not only with SDB but also without SDB in Japan, because it may improve hemodynamics through its favorable effect on preload and afterload. However, there have been very few evidences on ASV therapy for heart failure patients without SDB. This study “SAVIOR‐R” was carried out to establish real‐world evidences on this therapy. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 115 chronic heart failure patients who were firstly treated with ASV in 16 institutes from January to December 2009. Data on symptoms, echocardiography, chest X‐ray, plasma BNP and sleep study were obtained from medical records for baseline and on ASV for one year. Results: After ASV therapy, the ratio of NYHA class≥III patients decreased significantly from 43.2 to 23.5% (p=0.0002), LVEF increased significantly from 34.9±16.0 to 39.8±16.6% (Mean±SD, P=0.0092). The improvement in LVEF was more remarkable in the low LVEF group as compared with the preserved‐LVEF group. BNP and CTR were also improved, although these changes did not reach statistical significance. These effects of ASV were consistent irrespective of the degree of SDB. Conclusion: ASV therapy would improve symptoms and cardiac function in chronic heart failure patients regardless of accompanying SDB. A randomized controlled trial to confirm the effects of ASV not through the attenuation of SDB is needed.

AB: Clinical trials identified intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti‐VEGF agents) have the potential to stabilise or even improve visual acuity outcomes in neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), a sight‐threatening disease. Real‐world evidence allows us to assess whether results from randomised controlled trials can be applied to the general population. We describe the development of global registries, in particular the Fight Retinal Blindness! registry that originated in Australia, the United Kingdom AMD Electronic Medical Records User Group and the IRIS registry in the USA. Real‐world observations relating to efficacy, safety and resource utilisation of intravitreal anti‐VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD are then summarised. Novel observations that would have been challenging to identify in a clinical trial setting are then highlighted, including the risk of late disease reactivation, outcomes in second versus first treated eyes, and the increased risk of posterior capsular rupture during cataract surgery in patients who have received intravitreal anti‐VEGF therapy. We conclude by exploring future directions in the field. This includes the development of a global consensus on real‐world outcome measures to allow greater comparison of results. Real‐world neovascular AMD outcome registries can be linked with other databases to determine systemic safety or genetic predictors of treatment efficacy. Machine learning offers opportunities to extract useful insights from "Big Data" often collected in these registries. Real‐world registries could be used by drug regulatory authorities and industry as an alternative to more costly and time‐consuming phase 4 clinical trials, potentially allowing medication costs to be based on outcomes achieved.

AB: Background: Real‐world evidence of statin side effects is potentially biased because statin use is neither randomized nor unblinded. An innovative study design can mitigate these biases. For example, in the recent ASCOT‐LLA trial, patient‐reported adverse events such as muscle pain and weakness were higher in the non‐randomized and non‐blinded setting than in the randomized, blinded setting. Less optimally, secondary re‐analysis of clinical trials in which statin use is recorded and in which serious adverse events (SAEs) are adjudicated may be conducted. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate SAEs by statin use at baseline among participants in the SPRINT blood pressure (BP) management trial. Methods: Unadjusted overall SAE and treatment‐related SAE rates by statin use as well as adjusted hazard ratios for statin use were computed in four cohorts [by baseline clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), by intervention arm]. Results: Statin use at baseline was not associated with higher overall or treatment‐related SAE rates among (1) those without pre‐existing CVD, regardless of BP arm, nor among (2) those randomized to standard BP management, regardless of pre‐existing CVD. Among higher risk patients with existing clinical CVD randomized to intensive BP management, a small but significant increase in overall SAE rate was found among those taking statin at baseline. Conclusions: In SPRINT, generally statin use was not associated with increased risk of reporting SAEs. Only statin use by higher risk patients was associated with more overall SAEs. Confounding by clinical CVD and the polytherapy of intensive BP management may explain this. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)

AB: In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to confer glycaemic and extra‐glycaemic benefits. The DARWIN‐T2D (DApagliflozin Real World evIdeNce in Type 2 Diabetes) study was a multicentre retrospective study designed to evaluate the baseline characteristics of patients receiving dapagliflozin vs those receiving selected comparators (dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors, gliclazide, or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists), and drug effectiveness in routine clinical practice. From a population of 281217, the analysis included 17285 patients initiating dapagliflozin or comparator glucose‐lowering medications (GLMs), 6751 of whom had a follow‐up examination. At baseline, participants starting dapagliflozin were younger, had a longer disease duration, higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration, and a more complex history of previous GLM use, but the clinical profile of patients receiving dapagliflozin changed during the study period. Dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c by 0.7%, body weight by 2.7 kg, and systolic blood pressure by 3.0 mm Hg. Effects of comparator GLMs were also within the expected range, based on RCTs. This real‐world study shows an initial channelling of dapagliflozin to difficult‐to‐treat patients. Nonetheless, dapagliflozin provided significant benefits with regard to glucose control, body weight and blood pressure that were in line with findings from RCTs.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Only 63% of the US population aged 50‐75 years is adherent with recommended colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines. Efforts are needed to increase screening for CRC. METHODS: We evaluated a quality improvement intervention conducted in 2010 at Group Health in Washington State to assess the use of interactive voice response (IVR) systems to improve CRC screening. Eligible members were aged 50‐81 years, received primary care from a contracted physician, and were due for CRC screening. A total of 13,279 members were identified and randomly assigned to either: (1) an intervention with IVR to encourage CRC screening (n=10,000), or (2) usual care (n=3279). The primary outcome was receipt of any recommended CRC screening test at 6 months postintervention or index date. We used Cox proportional hazards to model time until receipt of CRC screening at 6 months. RESULTS: Adherence to CRC screening was 10.0% in the intervention arm and 7.8% in the usual care arm at 6 months. Randomization to the IVR intervention arm was associated with a 32% increased likelihood of receiving CRC screening (hazard ratio=1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.14, 1.52) compared with usual care. The difference in CRC screening uptake was apparent by 3 months and persisted for 12 months postintervention (log‐rank test, P=0.0012). DISCUSSION: Our analysis provides "real‐world" evidence that IVR is effective when delivered by a commercial health plan, and may be a useful tool for increasing adherence to screening guidelines among patients outside an integrated care practice.

AB: Introduction and hypothesis Mirabegron is a new beta 3 agonist for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Although there are extensive data from randomised controlled trials, there is little real world evidence about its effectiveness and side effects. We conducted a prospective cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of mirabegron as third‐line treatment in patients with refractory OAB who did not benefit from antimuscarinic therapy and bladder drill. Methods The study was a prospective consecutive cohort of 67 women treated with mirabegron 50 mg. All the patients had symptoms of urgency with or without urgency incontinence and had failed to improve with bladder drill and at least one antimuscarinic medication. The outcomes were assessed after 6 weeks using the International Consultation of Incontinence Modular Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ‐SF), Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI‐I) scale and Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ). Results The mean number of previous antimuscarinics was 2.81 (range 1‐6). Forty out of 67 patients (60 %) described an improvement in their OAB. Responders demonstrated a significant improvement in 5 out of 10 domains of the KHQ. Similarly, the ICI‐Q score improved from a mean of 12.7 (±5.3) to 9.2 (±5.3; p ≤ 0.008). Seven women (10 %) stopped mirabegron because of side effects. Conclusions This post‐marketing surveillance study confirms that mirabegron improves clinical and quality of life outcomes in patients with OAB. The rate of side effects was low. This study supports mirabegron use as a third‐line treatment for overactive bladder. © 2014 The International Urogynecological Association.

AB: The intervention to be tested, Pathways to Freedom (PTF), is a video‐based program that will be examined as an adjunct to tobacco cessation services provided through a state quitline. Investigators will conduct a 3‐arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to obtain real‐world evidence for the efficacy of the PTF DVD. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive standard care plus PTF DVD, standard care plus standard smoking cessation DVD, or standard care only; assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months post‐enrollment. All participants will receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Thus, the impact of the PTF DVD will be isolated, informing investigators whether standard telephone counseling can be enhanced by the provision of a culturally specific DVD‐based intervention. The primary abstinence outcome will be cotinine‐verified 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence (ppa) at the 6‐month follow‐up; secondary outcomes will be 7‐day ppa at 3‐months, 24‐hour ppa, and 28‐day continuous abstinence. Objective 1: To test the efficacy of an innovative evidence‐based smoking cessation DVD targeting African American smokers. Investigators will conduct a 3‐arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to obtain real‐world evidence for the efficacy of the Pathway to Freedom (PTF) DVD. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive standard care plus PTF DVD, standard care plus standard smoking cessation DVD, or standard care only; assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months post‐enrollment. All participants will receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Thus, the impact of the PTF DVD will be isolated, informing us of whether standard telephone counseling can be enhanced by the provision of a culturally specific DVD‐based intervention. The primary abstinence outcome will be cotinine‐verified 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence (ppa) at the 6‐month follow‐up; secondary outcomes will be 7‐day ppa at 3‐months, 24‐hour ppa, and 28‐day continuous abstinence. Controlling for covariates (any group differences in socio‐demographics, smoking history, and NRT use), the study hypothesizes that standard care plus the PTF DVD will produce greater abstinence rates compared to standard care plus a standard cessation DVD. In this study, it is also expect that the greater abstinence rates in the PTF DVD condition will be maintained over time. Objective 2: To examine the effect of the PTF DVD on treatment engagement. Previous research suggests that culturally specific interventions are preferred by African American smokers compared to standard interventions. This preference may impact engagement in treatment, which would also represent an important indicator of success. Controlling for baseline differences, this study hypothesizes that the PTF DVD will lead to greater engagement in treatment, specifically positive evaluations of the telephone counseling and smoking cessation DVDs, session length, completed counseling sessions, DVD viewing, NRT use, use of coping strategies, and study retention compared to the standard DVD control group. Objective 3 (exploratory): To assess the feasibility of delivering the PTF DVD in an online format. Although there are several indications that a DVD format is cutting edge for African American smokers, who tend to be of lower socioeconomic status and have less Internet access, the study will assess the acceptability and utilization of delivering the video interventions in an online format. Specifically, at the 3 and 6‐month follow‐ups, participants will rate their satisfaction and experience with accessing the videos in each condition via a private YouTube channel, and report the frequency of online viewing. As this is an exploratory aim, there is no specific hypotheses.

AB: Background: External drivers are increasing demand for high quality real‐world evidence (RWE) for safety and effectiveness of medical products as used by patients in their usual healthcare environment. RWE informs key decisions from development program plans and accelerated regulatory approvals to market access and reimbursement. A shift to including patients' preferences in study designs offers a focus on unmet needs and pursuit of novel data collection to capture meaningful endpoints. To date, most RWE is generated from retrospective studies using large insurance claims and electronic healthcare record (EHR) databases created for non‐research purposes. Public‐private partnerships have advanced networks of e‐health databases using common data models that enable distributed and efficient analyses while maintaining data privacy and security. Harmonizing databases involves tradeoffs, resulting in questions about data quality, validation, generalizability, and gaps where data are not routinely or systematically captured within and across systems. Several large EHR‐enabled pragmatic RCTs conducted in routine clinical practice have been initiated in the UK (Salford Lung Studies) and USA (ADAPTABLE), which offer key insights with respect to the design, conduct and interpretation phases in this rapidly evolving field. Objectives: To review: a) how epidemiology can impact pragmatic RCT study design and interpretation; b) algorithm development, linkage, quality assessment and validation of EHR data; c) strengths and limitations of current infrastructure and operational capabilities to conduct pragmatic RCTs incorporating remotely captured data; and d) future direction of regulatory and payer perspectives on different randomized vs observational study designs by decision type. Description: The panel will discuss the issues raised by the case examples, highlighting emerging guidance and recommendations for further collaboration with a call to action for ISPE membership. Future directions and implications for regulatory, payer, patient and industry landscapes will also be discussed via a moderated Q&A.

AB: Objectives: A substantial part of real‐world evidence data in oncology are generated based on medical record reviews (MRRs). This study aims to (1) summarize methodology recommendations for oncology studies based on a MRR, (2) describe methodological trade‐offs MRR studies in oncology might face, and (3) provide guidance on how to do MRR studies, in particular, how to deal with potential tradeoffs. Material and Methods: A review of existing guidelines and methodology publications involving MRRs was conducted. We compared the review results with the outcomes of a large MRR study in advanced non‐squamous lung cancer (LENS study) and a supplementary validation study that retrieved additional data and assessed study protocol adherence from participating study centers. Results: A 42‐item MRR checklist was developed based on the methodology recommendations identified in our literature review. The MRR checklist provides methodological guidance on MRR‐based oncology studies. Main items on this checklist included: general study methodology, site and patient selection, definition of outcomes and confounders, data collection procedures, methods to assess and control bias, data storage, security and privacy procedures, quality assessment and validation of data, statistical analysis including handling of missing data, and reporting. Even when a MRR study generally follows all of these 42 methodology recommendations, a series of additional design decisions need to be made. Major areas in this respect which strongly influence internal or external validity of study results are study site and patient selection (convenience, consecutive or randomized sampling), selection of variables to be documented including minimum requirements for available data, and choice of methods to deal with missing data. Conclusions: MRR studies in oncology could benefit from the recommendations outlined in our checklist. In addition, we recommend that, when designing a MRR study in oncology, a principal decision should be made on the degree of external validity required.

AB: Objective: In a randomized clinical trial (COU‐AA‐301), abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®) was shown to be superior to prednisone in the treatment of metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, the value of abiraterone treatment for patients with mCRPC in clinical practice in Sweden is not known. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes and treatment patterns of abiraterone treatment in a Swedish observational study to those of the pivotal clinical trial, thereby discussing the external validity of the postchemotherapy clinical trial from a Swedish perspective. Materials and methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted using data from three Swedish hospitals. Data were retrieved from 119 eligible patients diagnosed with mCRPC, treated during 2013 and 2014. Swedish real‐world evidence sample characteristics, treatment patterns and duration, and overall survival were compared to the clinical trial data. Results: Analyses of the data showed that patients were treated for a median of 5.6 months, which was significantly shorter than the treatment duration in the clinical trial (7.3 months). A comparison indicated that the Swedish patients were similar to patients included in the clinical trial in observed patient characteristics, but perhaps less likely to benefit from treatment owing to prior ketoconazole treatment and possibly higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Despite this, the Swedish patients had non‐significantly longer overall survival and significantly shorter treatment duration. Conclusion: Swedish patients could expect the same overall survival as patients randomized to abiraterone in the clinical trial despite shorter treatment duration, leading to a more cost‐effective use of the treatment in the real world compared to the clinical trial.

AB: Managed Access Agreements (MAAs) are agreements between NHS England and manufacturers to enable a drug to become available for a limited time period at a discounted price. This allows patients to access the drug whilst further evidence is gathered on its real‐world effectiveness. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) subsequently re‐issues guidance on whether this drug should be funded. In December 2015, elosulfase alfa (Vimizim), which treats Morquio A syndrome became the first therapy to be recommended by NICE with an associated MAA. In April 2016, NICE issued draft guidance recommending ataluren (Translarna) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, conditional on an MAA. MAAs can provide an access route for drugs for very rare diseases, which typically have a limited supporting clinical evidence base and significant associated uncertainties alongside high treatment costs. Indeed, elosulfase alfa (costing £395,000 per patient annually 3 people are born with this condition every year in the UK) and ataluren (costing £222,000 per patient annually; 50 patients are estimated to receive ataluren under the 5‐year MAA) had previously been rejected by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC). The number of therapies approved in Europe supported by a clinical data package lacking large multicentre, randomized, comparative Phase 3 trials will likely increase, driven by the EMA Adaptive Pathways pilot alongside very promising new pipeline therapy classes (e.g. CAR‐T and gene therapies). For cancer therapies lacking supportive Phase 3 data, under new arrangements for the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), promising drugs for which the evidence is not strong enough can temporarily enter the CDF to collect real‐world evidence to help inform subsequent NICE appraisals. MAAs therefore can similarly provide a model that allows temporary patient access whilst additional evidence is generated for non‐oncology drugs that treat severe, rare diseases.

AB: Objectives: HCV infections represent a major worldwide public health problem and are responsible for a large proportion of liver related deaths, mostly because of HCV‐associated hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. In the last years, the launch of direct acting antiviral drugs has seen sustained virological response rates reach 90% and above for many patient groups. The new treatments are effective on SVR rates, well tolerated, allow for shorter treatment regimens based on clinical data. In 2015 year 4 new regims have been introduced to Polish reimbursement system to tread HCV for genotyp 1 (ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir or sofosbuvir / ledipasvir), 1B (daklatascir / asunaprevir), 2 (sofosbuvir with ribavirin or sofosbuvir / peginterferon / ribavirin), 3 (sofosbuvir with ribavirin or sofosbuwir with with peginterferon and ribavirin), 4 (ombitasvir / paritaprevirm / ritonavir / dasabuvir or sofosbuvir / rybavirin or sofosbuvir with ribavirin or sofosbuvir / peginterferon / ribavirin), 5 (sofosbuvir with ribavirin or sofosbuvir / peginterferon / ribavirin). The first result will be obtaind from patients treated by new therapies and offer new opportunities for previously excluded groups. This therapeutic revolution has changed the rules for treatment of HCV, moving the field towards an interferon‐free era and raising the prospect of HCV eradication. Methods: Retrospective patients data collection in 4 hospitals with the highest contract with NHF have begun on April 2016. We will collect: number of patients treated, characteristics of patients, ETR, SVR24, safety, reason of preliminary cessation of treatment. Results: The data collection will be finished at the end of July 2016. Conclusions: The aim of study is to compare real world evidence data in Polish drug programs with data from clinical trials. This therapeutic revolution has changed the rules for treatment of HCV, moving the field towards an interferon‐free era and raising the prospect of HCV eradication.

DOI: 10.1016/j.ejso.2018.01.554
AB: Background: Definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is increasingly considered an alternative to surgery for the curative treatment of oesophageal carcinoma. This regimen, tested in the UK SCOPE 1 trial, consists of cisplatin/capecitabine for four cycles; cycles three and four given concurrently with 50Gy in 25 fractions of radiotherapy. Carboplatin/paclitaxel can be used when cisplatin/5FU is contraindicated due to co‐morbidities. The SCOPE 1 trial showed a median overall survival (OS) of 25 months for patients receiving cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine based treatment, with 2 year OS of 56%, which compares well to outcomes from surgical series. Method: We reviewed all cases of oesophageal cancer planned for dCRT between March 2012 to April 2017. The primary end point of the analysis was median OS. Results: 52 patients were identified.Median age was 72 (63%70 years). 44% were female, 56% male. Commonest stage at presentation was IIIA. 63% had adenocarcinoma, 35% SCC and 2% adenosquamous. 67% were located in the lower 1/3, 27% middle 1/3, 4% upper 1/3 and 2% had data missing. 60% patients were treated with cisplatin and 5FU/capecitabine, 35% with carboplatin/paclitaxel and 5% had induction ECX followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel or cisplatin/capectiabine. 94% patients received 50Gy in 25#. The median OS for all patients was 16 months, with median OS of 21 months for SCC and 15 months for adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Our 'real life' cohort shows a lower overall median OS than the published SCOPE1 data (16 vs 25 months) for dCRT treatment of oesophageal cancer. However there are differences between the cohorts, namely shorter follow up time and smaller proportion of patients with SCC (70% SCOPE 1 vs 35% here). Median OS for the SCC group was notably higher. We believe this provides further real world evidence of dCRT being a valid alternative to surgery, particularly so for SCC.

AB: Background: Clinical trial designs undergo constant evolution driven by changing scientific needs and corresponding regulatory demands. Early clinical research was dominated by case series and anecdotal reports. Randomized controlled trials emerged by the 1940s, and increasingly rigorous standards led to the modern 3‐phase system. Recent studies have shifted from larger trials with post‐hoc identification of subgroups to smaller trials conducted in selected populations. As trial designs continue to evolve, the field must monitor the success of new approaches to confirm that they lead to faster rates of progress with reproducible results. Methods: The PACE Continuous Innovation IndicatorsTM(CII) is a comprehensive historical database of evidence supporting cancer treatments for 12 solid tumors. The CII systematically tracks results from published studies measuring overall survival. An interactive user interface allows users to examine how progress against cancer occurs over time, including the contribution of different types of evidence. Results: Data from the CII illustrate the accumulation of evidence for improved overall survival over decades of clinical research. Historically, Phase 3 trials contribute only 28% of the evidence, while Phase 2 trials contribute an additional 7%. The remaining evidence arises from observational and retrospective studies, meta‐analyses, and systematic reviews. Moreover, approximately 27% of the evidence is from studies combining data from different cohorts to increase statistical power. These larger and heterogeneous designs often provide the first evidence of efficacy at the group or class level and are followed by additional studies to better understand the underlying effect. CII data can be used to track the impact of the current transition toward smaller, targeted studies. Our results highlight the need for timely and data‐driven tracking of progress across the spectrum of cancer research and fast learning from real‐world evidence to validate outcomes. Conclusions: We make the CII freely available to all stakeholders and encourage users to perform their own custom analyses.

AB: Purpose: In the MONITOR‐GCSF study of chemotherapy‐induced (febrile) neutropenia with biosimilar filgrastim, 56.6% of patients were prophylacted according to amended EORTC guidelines, but 17.4% were prophylacted below and 26.0% above guideline recommendations. Methods: MONITOR‐GCSF is a prospective, observational study of 1447 evaluable patients from 140 cancers centers in 12 European countries treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles receiving biosimilar GCSF prophylaxis. Patients were classified as under‐, correctly‐, or over‐prophylacted with GCSF relative to guideline recommendations based on their chemotherapy risk, individual risk factors, and type of GCSF prophylaxis (primary versus secondary). Results: Differences between under‐ (17.4%), correctly‐ (56.6%), or over‐prophylacted (26.0%) groups were found in terms of patient risk factors (age, performance status, history of FN, comorbid conditions) as well as prophylaxis patterns (type of prophylaxis, day of GCSF initiation, and GCSF duration). Rates of chemotherapy‐induced neutropenia (CIN) (all grades), FN, and CIN‐related hospitalizations were consistently lower in over‐prophylacted patients relative to under‐ and correctly‐prophylacted patients. No differences were observed between under‐ and correctly‐prophylacted patients except for CIN/FN‐related chemotherapy disturbances. No GCSF safety differences were found between groups (except for headaches). Conclusions: The real‐world evidence provided by the MONITOR‐GCSF study indicates that providing GCSF support may yield better CIN, FN, and CIN/FN‐related hospitalization outcomes if patients are prophylacted at levels above guideline recommendations. Patients who are under‐prophylacted are at higher risk for disturbances to their chemotherapy regimens. Our findings support the guideline recommendation that CIN/FN risk be assessed at the beginning of each chemotherapy cycle. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)

AB: Nivolumab is an indispensable agent at present for unresectable malignant melanoma (MM) treatment, but the real world evidence after launch is insufficient. Since July 2014, when nivolumab was approved in Japan, prospective post‐marketing surveillance (PMS) that is a system specific to Japan is being conducted for all MM patients treated with nivolumab in Japan. PMS data were collected from all MM patients treated with nivolumab in Japan in the period from July 2014 to May 2016 (data cut‐off). The surveillance data on follow‐up for 6 months or longer (maximum 458 days) were available on 680 patients. Interim data analysis was conducted. Of 680 MM patients, 389 cutaneous melanomas (57.2%) and 208 mucosal melanomas (30.6%) were recorded. Patients with ECOG performance status (PS) of 2‐4 and patients with preexisting autoimmune disorders, who are not able to participate in most clinical trials, accounted for 16.9% (n = 115) and 11.8% (n = 80), respectively. The incidences of drug‐related adverse events (AEs) in any grade was 53.5% (n = 364) and grade 3‐5 was 12.4% (n = 84). Notable drug‐related AEs included colitis/diarrhea (n = 34), interstitial lung disease (ILD) (n = 22), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (n = 5), myasthenia gravis (MG) and myositis (n = 4). In terms of the patient characteristics, there was no difference in incidence of drug‐related AEs when stratified according to age, gender, PS, pre‐LDH and preexisting autoimmune disorders. Based on the surveillance data collected at this time, the tolerability of nivolumab in Japanese patients with MM was largely favorable despite the fact that patients with preexisting autoimmune disorders and patients with PS 2 or higher were included. However, serious immune‐related AEs such as colitis, ILD, T1DM and MG should be carefully monitored.

AB: Objective: In light of the GPP3 and MPIP‐endorsed initiative of strengthening scientific communication, posting of congress presentations forms an important aspect of scientific data sharing and transparency. We searched biomedical conferences to observe the extent of post‐congress archiving and public accessibility to research presentations and also to study the features of this scientific evidence. Methods: We identified conferences utilizing the Sylogent 'Conference authority' tool in therapeutic areas of oncology (>5000 attendees) and neurosciences (under headings of psychiatry, psychology, psychopharmacology, neurology or neuroscience, >1000 attendees). Official websites of individual conferences/societies/publishing platforms were searched for postings of electronic conference presentations: ePosters, slidedecks and presentations in pdf formats or video recordings. All freely accessible presentations were screened to observe the categories of document types. Results: Total 80 neurosciences and 13 oncology conferences were identified of which 21/80 (26%) in neurosciences and 6/13 (46%) in oncology allowed ePoster submissions. Archives of ePosters were available in 13/80 (16%) neurosciences and 4/13 (31%) oncology conferences; of these, most conferences provided restricted access to members. Video recordings of oral presentations were available for 3/80 neuroscience conferences. Archives of ePosters/slides in F1000 platform were available for 21 neuroscience and 15 oncology conferences. Critical data from trials‐in‐progress, proof‐of‐concept, first‐in‐class, first‐in‐human, patient‐reported outcomes, real‐world evidence, phase 2/3 randomized‐controlled studies and secondary subgroup analyses were available in the accessible archives of congress presentations. Conclusion: Our research showed limited public postings and accessibility of post‐congress presentations. Conferences can encourage timely and transparent dissemination of valuable research findings and emphasize that these remain unpublished data until a peer‐reviewed publication is available.

AB: BACKGROUND: Alefacept was the first biologic therapy approved by Health Canada for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and is used either alone or as part of combination therapy. OBJECTIVE: AWARE (Amevive Wisdom Acquired from Real‐World Evidence) is a multicenter, observational phase IV Canadian study of psoriasis patients treated with alefacept. This study's main goals were to develop a shared, real‐time, national clinical database to support best practice and optimize the care of patients receiving alefacept and to gain an understanding of how alefacept is used in Canadian clinical practice. Baseline patient demographic data are described herein. METHODS: Patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were enrolled from 37 clinics across Canada. Subjects received at least one course of alefacept treatment followed by a period of at least 12 weeks off treatment and were prospectively followed for at least 60 weeks. Baseline assessments included patient demographics, relevant medical history, psoriasis and treatment history, reasons for initiating alefacept, enrolling physician's initial alefacept treatment plan and strategy, percent body surface area (BSA) involvement with psoriasis, and physician's baseline assessment of disease control. Subsequent assessments at each follow‐up visit included the patient's response and the physician's assessment. RESULTS: A total of 426 adult patients with predominantly chronic plaque psoriasis, with or without other types of psoriasis, were enrolled into the AWARE registry. Patients generally had moderate to severe psoriasis, with more than half (55.8%) having little or no disease control at baseline as assessed by their clinician, and 77% had > 10% BSA involvement with psoriasis. All patients in the AWARE patient population were receiving one or more treatments for psoriasis prior to or at the time of enrolment, and the majority continued to receive concomitant treatments at the time of study enrolment. CONCLUSION: The AWARE registry enrolled a broad group of real‐world patients with chronic plaque psoriasis treated with alefacept in clinical practices across Canada.

AB: Background and aims: Fingolimod (FTY720; Gilenya, Novartis Pharma AG) is approved for the treatment of relapsing MS. As of August 2016, approximately 160,000 patients have been treated with Fingolimod. PANGAEA (Post‐Authorization Non‐interventional German sAfety study of GilEnyA in RRMS patients) is a non‐interventional study, conducted in Germany, to investigate long‐term safety, effectiveness and patient reported outcomes in daily practice. Methods: 4229 patients were enrolled into PANGAEA. By Jan 2017 over 300 patients finished the five year documentation period. Here we present safety and adherence data of fingolimod treatment in daily clinical practice for up to five years. Results: Over five years, the yearly mean study discontinuation rate was 12%. 67% of patients who started fingolimod treatment between 2011 and 2013 in PANGAEA are still on drug. 79% of patients who discontinued the study also discontinued fingolimod. Most frequent reasons for study discontinuation (multiple answers possible) were patient's decision (33%) and adverse events (28%). Over five years, the safety profile of fingolimod in real world is comparable to that observed in phase III clinical trials. Common adverse events were reductions in lymphocyte counts, increase in liver enzyme values, upper respiratory tract infections (e.g. nasopharyngitis [9.9%]), and MS related adverse events like fatigue (3.4%) and depression (2.6%). Approximately 45% of the patients experienced no adverse events. 3.9% of all adverse events were rated as serious. Conclusion: The results of PANGAEA support the positive benefit‐risk profile fingolimod, demonstrated in clinical trials, with real world evidence data. The frequency/nature of reported adverse events is consistent with previous findings.

AB: Background and aims: Fingolimod (FTY720; Gilenya, Novartis Pharma AG) is approved for the treatment of relapsing MS. As of August 2016, approximately 160,000 patients have been treated with fingolimod in both clinical trials and the post‐marketing setting. PANGAEA (Post‐Authorization Non‐interventional German sAfety of GilEnyA in RRMS patients) is a non‐interventional study, conducted in Germany, to investigate long‐term safety, effectiveness and patient reported outcomes in daily practice. Methods: 4229 patients were enrolled into PANGAEA. By Jan 2017, over 300 patients completed the five year documentation period. Here we present effectiveness data of fingolimod treatment in daily clinical practice for up to five years. Results: The mean (+/‐SD) age of the patients was 39.4(+/‐10.0) years. The mean (95%CI) annual relapse rate improved from 1.5+/‐0.13 at baseline to 0.42+/‐0.08 after 12 months and further improved to 0.29+/‐0.04 after five years. The mean (95%CI) EDSS at baseline was 3.0+/‐0.03 and remained stable over five years. In each year of treatment more than 90% of the patients had a stable EDSS, over 70% of the patients were free of relapses and 6‐month confirmed disability progression. 45% of the patients neither had a relapse nor disability progression over four years of treatment. Patient reported outcomes evaluated in a sub‐study (n=830) confirmed the effectiveness and convenience profile of fingolimod from a patient point of view. Conclusion: The results of the five year interim analysis of PANGAEA support the positive effectiveness profile of fingolimod, demonstrated in phase III clinical trials with real world evidence data.

AB: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate payer perceptions and utilization of t he Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) Value Assessment Framework in coverage decisions. METHODS: A double‐blinded, web‐based survey was dissemi‐ nated to 57 individuals within managed care organizations, heath systems, and academic institutions in November 2016. The survey assessed payers' experience and involvement with the ICER Framework, their perceived strengths and limitations of the Framework, and the level of influence the Framework had in recent coverage decisions. RESULTS: 55 payers representing 47 organizations completed the survey. All respondents were active members of a pharmacy & therapeutics committee. T he majority of payers (67%) were familiar with the ICER Framework methodology and 36% reported reviewing one or more ICER evaluations within the preceding 12 months. Few participants (11%) reported that their organization actively engaged in a prior ICER review (eg, providing public comments, meeting attendance). 5 1% of respondents said that ICER's recommendations had not influenced decisions, 44% noted occasional influence on decisions, and 5% said the recommendations often influenced decisions within their organization. As a whole, respondents indicated that use of real‐world evidence (60%), transparency of methodology (53%), and choice of clinical outcomes (44%) were strengths of the Framework. Limitations noted by payers included: timing of evidence reporting vis‐a‐vis decision making needs (45%), lack of stakeholder engagement (38%), and use of fixed thresholds for cost per qualityadjusted life year and budget impact (35%). Regardless of current application, the majority of respondents (96%) agreed the Framework has potential to be more influential in future decision‐making. CONCLUSIONS: While many payers are familiar with the ICER Framework and recognize its potential impact, its actual application in the decision‐making process has been limited. Findings from this survey indicate that utilization for decision‐making may be increasing, though additional studies will be needed to confirm anticipated trends.

AB: OBJECTIVES: The advent of new, costly disease‐modifying‐therapies (DMT) for multiple sclerosis (MS) requires consideration of all evidence on comparative effectiveness with existing therapies to inform both health policy and clinical care. This study compares the relative effectiveness of DMTs within a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) framework, and explores the contribution of real‐world evidence from observational studies to the evidence‐base. METHODS: Sixteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four observational studies incorporating nine DMTs were identified according to specified inclusion criteria following a systematic review of the literature. A Bayesian MTC model was fitted in WinBUGS, for the outcome Annualised Relapse Rate (ARR). Alternative methods of combining data from different trial designs were used. The model was extended to a meta‐regression to include baseline covariates. RESULTS: Natalizumab and Fingolimod, two recently approved DMTs, were significantly more effective than other DMTs for the ARR outcome versus placebo, while the least effective option was Interferon beta‐ 1a 6MIU. Minimal differences were observed among the other DMTs. Baseline covariates had no significant impact on the results. Observational data was available only for the older DMTs. An MTC of these trials supported the ranking in effectiveness obtained from the RCT MTC, although individual estimates of effectiveness were different to RCT estimates and uncertainty was substantial. As an alternative to naïve pooling of both RCT and observational data, utilising the observational data as prior information allowed for adjustment of bias due to trial design. CONCLUSIONS: Relative clinical effectiveness of DMTs is an important component in the assessment of cost‐effectiveness of these agents. RCTs provide the foundation for evaluating comparative effectiveness of DMTs. However, observational studies can contribute complementary evidence on important comparative effectiveness questions.

AB: Background: To present real‐world evidence on the effects of switching from oral to long‐acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic maintenance treatment (AMT) in a sample of clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, with regard to subjective experience of treatment, attitude towards drug and quality of life. Methods: 50 clinically stable adult schizophrenic outpatients were recruited. At the time of enrolment (T0), all patients were under a stabilized therapy with a single oral second‐generation antipsychotic (SGA) and were switched to the equivalent maintenance regimen with the long‐acting formulation of the same antipsychotic. 43 patients completed the 24‐month prospective, longitudinal, open‐label, observational study. Participants were assessed at baseline (T0), after 12 (T1) and 24 months (T2), using psychometric scales (PANSS, YMRS and MDRS) and patient‐reported outcome measures (SWN‐K, DAI‐10 and SF‐36). Results: The switch to LAI‐AMT was associated with a significant clinical improvement at T1 and T2 compared to baseline (T0). All of the psychometric indexes, as well as patients’ subjective experience of treatment (SWN‐K), and quality of life (SF‐36) showed a significant improvement after one year of LAI‐AMT, with stable results after two years. Patients’ attitude towards drug (DAI‐10) increased throughout the follow‐up period, with a further improvement during the second year. Conclusions: The switch to LAI‐AMT may help to address the subjective core of an optimal recovery in stabilized schizophrenic patients. A sustained improvement in patients’ attitude towards drug may help to achieve patient's compliance. The size of this study needs to be expanded to produce more solid and generalizable results.

AB: Background Teriparatide is the first anabolic agent shown to reduce the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis. In Japan, teriparatide is prescribed to treat patients at high risk of fracture. Given that bisphosphonates are commonly used prior to teriparatide as treatment for osteoporosis, information on the effectiveness and safety of teriparatide with or without previous bisphosphonate treatment is helpful for physicians in clinical practice. This study aims to report the effectiveness and safety of teriparatide in treatment‐naive and bisphosphonate‐pretreated patients in Japan as real‐world evidence. Methods A post hoc analysis of a postmarketing surveillance study was conducted in Japanese patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture who received 24‐month treatment of daily teriparatide. Changes in bone turnover biomarkers and bone mineral density and incidence of new fractures were analyzed in treatment‐naive as well as bisphosphonate‐pretreated patients. Results The analysis included 1433 patients (treatment‐naive, n = 659; bisphosphonate‐pretreated, n = 774). Bone mineral density increased significantly from baseline at 24 months in both treatment‐naive (lumbar spine, 13.45%; femoral neck, 5.16%; total hip, 4.46%) and bisphosphonate‐pretreated (lumbar spine, 11.20%; femoral neck, 2.22%; total hip, 0.67%) patients. The incidence rates of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures at 24 months were 1.69% and 3.37%, respectively, in treatment‐naive patients and 3.60% and 5.56%, respectively, in bisphosphonate‐pretreated patients. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was 6% in treatment‐naive patients and 10% in bisphosphonate‐pretreated patients. The most common adverse drug reaction in treatment‐naive and bisphosphonate‐pretreated patients was nausea (0.91%) and hyperuricaemia (1.81%), respectively. Conclusions In this post hoc analysis, no new safety concerns and similar effectiveness of teriparatide were observed in Japanese patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, regardless of their previous treatment status with bisphosphonates.

AB: Objectives: The extrapolation of survival curves is key when conducting cost‐effectiveness analyses in oncology, which strongly rely on progression‐free and overall survival outcomes. Although methodological guidance for extrapolation have been published, the need to choose a specific distribution through internal validation of model fit, and external validation using long‐term data remains arbitrary especially if one expects some heterogeneity in outcomes between patients. The objective was to investigate the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), using randomized controlled trial data in renal cell carcinoma (Checkmate 214). Methods: Parametric and cubic spline survival analyses were implemented in a Bayesian setting using WinBugs. BMA methods were applied, providing a framework for understanding extrapolation uncertainty by considering probabilities of the distribution selected being the most appropriate given the data. Survival curves were weighted in order to obtain one single extrapolation. This distribution was first weighted on the basis of BIC statistics, using an uninformative prior. The use of informative priors through the elicitation of expert opinions and real world evidence was also investigated. Results: With uninformative priors, the OS extrapolation was driven by the log‐normal distribution which obtained a weight of 73% followed by the normal cubic spline model with one knot which obtained a weight of 9%. The mean curve was similar to the distribution with best fit (log‐normal). The inclusion of informative priors was evaluated through the use of external studies and experts opinions. Conclusions: The BMA method is a useful additional tool to the currently recognised methodological guidance on extrapolation. With the underlying assumption that no one distribution is appropriate through the entire time horizon given clinical heterogeneity, it allows to empirically account for all data sources in choices of extrapolations through informative priors and the likelihood itself and accounts for the structural uncertainty associated with the choice of distribution.

AB: Objectives: The role of real world evidence (RWE) and comparative effectiveness research (CER) has received increasing attention in recent years. Healthcare decision makers are often informed of these studies and findings through peer‐reviewed publications. The purpose of this study was to examine the publication of studies that are not clinical randomized trials in major medical journals. Methods: Table of contents from 5 journals (New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA), Lancet, Circulation, and the British Medical Journal (BMJ)) were examined from January 2011 to December, 2015 to identify non‐randomized controlled trials (non‐RCTs). To be classified as a study of interest, the research must have examined clinical and/ or cost outcomes in which interventions are not randomly assigned and involved 2 or more interventions. Non‐RCTs were sub‐classified into one of the following categories: retrospective cohort or case control; prospective cohort; meta‐analysis (MA); network meta‐analysis (NMA); modeled cost‐effectiveness analysis (CEA); cost‐effectiveness with randomized controlled trial (CEA‐RCT); cost‐consequence analysis (CCA); discrete event simulation (DES); and prediction model derivation/ validation (PM). Descriptive, epidemiological evaluation, association, and trend studies were excluded. Results: A total of 575 publications met inclusion criteria. Journals with the highest to lowest number of studies of interest were BMJ (N= 269), JAMA (N= 102), Circulation (N= 100), Lancet (N= 75), and NEJM (N= 29). The most common study type was meta‐analysis (N= 322). Only eight CEA‐RCT studies were published during the study time frame. A total of 72 retrospective and 36 prospective cohort studies were published, with 12 of the prospective studies being published in NEJM. For all 5 journals, publication of non‐RCTs peaked in 2012. Conclusions: Publication of non‐RCT studies is not common, especially in NEJM. Among the five studied journals, the BMJ published the highest number of non‐RCT studies and the vast majority were meta‐analyses.

AB: Objectives: Based on the results of the randomized phase III BOLERO‐2 study, the everolimus plus exemestane combination was approved and is reimbursed in the Czech Republic in hormone‐receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER‐2) negative metastatic breast cancer after prior aromatase inhibitor therapy. However, the real‐world outcomes are unknown. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated HR‐positive, HER‐2 negative mBC patients with discontinued everolimus treatment in comprehensive cancer centre in the Czech Republic. The cost of drug and outcomes in the real‐life clinical practice were assessed and compared to registration study BOLERO‐2 (phase III clinical trial results: median age 62 years; median duration of exposure to everolimus was 5.0 months with median PFS 10.6 months, dose interruptions or reductions were required in 66.8% of patients). Results: A total of 73 patients with mBC (median age 64 years) were treated with everolimus plus exemestane in the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute between 2014 – 2017. The median duration of treatment was 5.98 months, median progression‐free survival was 6.6 months, the mean everolimus cost according to individual drug consumption was EUR 22,190 (CZK 572,491; EUR 1 = CZK 25.8). Adverse events led to dose reductions and/or discontinuation of treatment in 27 (37%) patients. Conclusions: The real‐world evidence confirms that everolimus and exemestane is an effective and safe treatment in HR‐positive, HER‐2 negative patients with mBC after previous therapy with non‐steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Nevertheless, the real‐world PFS, which is the key driver in all cost‐effectiveness models based on BOLERO‐2 results, was apparently lower than in the clinical trial settings.

DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdw382.14
AB: Background: Real‐world evidence of the significant impact of PET staging on survival outcomes because of stage migration (upstaging) has been previously documented. However, the effect of stage migration as a result of PET has rarely been measured in randomized trials in the locally advanced (stage IIIA/B) setting. Here, we report the results from post‐hoc subgroup analyses based on PET scan use in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the PROCLAIM study. Methods: The intent‐to‐treat (ITT) population of 598 patients with stage IIIA/B nonsquamous NSCLC were randomized to either pemetrexed (Pem) plus cisplatin (Cis) and concurrent radiotherapy (RT) for 3 cycles, followed by 4 cycles of Pem consolidation, or etoposide plus Cis and concurrent RT for 2 cycles, followed by a consolidation platinum‐based doublet regimen for up to 2 cycles. PET scan (yes vs no) was one of the stratification factors since its use was not required per protocol. Subgroup analyses (yes vs no PET) of OS and PFS were conducted on the ITT population regardless of treatment since the study did not demonstrate superior efficacy for either arm. Kaplan‐Meier methods and Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios. Results: Of the 598 patients, the majority (n = 491; 82.1%) had PET scan staging performed. The OS and PFS by PET scan use are presented in the table. In addition, results of subgroup analyses for each treatment arm were consistent with those of the ITT population. Conclusions: Both a significantly improved PFS and a numerically longer OS in the subgroup of patients with PET scans, compared to patients with conventional staging, are consistent with improved survival due to stage migration. The magnitude of differences in OS and PFS based on PET is a reminder of the potential for factors other than the therapeutic intervention to affect outcomes. (Table Presented).

AB: In this independent, multicentre post‐marketing study we directly compared the effectiveness of natalizumab (NTZ), fingolimod (FNG) and self‐injectable drugs (INJ), in non‐responders to first immunomodulating treatment and in highly active treatment‐naive patients with multiple sclerosis. As main outcome measure we considered the proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA‐3), defined as absence of relapses, disability worsening and radiological activity. A total of 567 non‐responders to interferon beta (IFNB) or glatiramer acetate (GA) [dataset A] and 216 highly active treatment‐naives [dataset B] were followed up to 24 months from the beginning of NTZ, FNG or INJ, i.e. switching from IFNB to GA or viceversa (in the case of non‐responders) or starting high‐dose IFNB (in the case of highly active treatment‐naives). Propensity score matching in a 1:1:1 ratio was used to select only patients with similar baseline characteristics, retaining 330 and 120 patients in dataset A and B, respectively. In dataset A, the 24‐month proportion with NEDA‐3 was greater in both NTZ group (67%) and FNG group (42%) than in INJ group (35%) (p < 0.016); however, NTZ was superior to FNG in promoting the attainment of NEDA‐3 status (p = 0.034). In dataset B, the 24‐month proportion with NEDA‐3 was greater in NTZ group (75%) and FNG group (67%) than in INJ group (40%), but the small cohort sizes most likely prevented the detection of any statistically significant difference. Our study provides real‐world evidence that NTZ was more effective than both FNG and INJ in non‐responders, while it could seem that, in highly active treatment‐naives, NTZ was as effective as FNG and both were superior to INJ.

AB: Background: In randomized clinical trials, dapagliflozin has been shown to improve glycemic control, weight, and blood pressure. However, there is little real‐world evidence of the effectiveness of dapagliflozin. The objective of this study is to investigate the real‐world treatment outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who initiated dapagliflozin in a referral‐based endocrinology practice. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with T2D who initiated dapagliflozin in 2015, using data from a large, specialist diabetes registry in Canada. Results: 1520 patients were eligible for analysis. Following 3 to 6 months of treatment, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) decreased by a mean of 0.9% +/‐ 1.3% (9.8 +/‐ 14.2 mmol/mol) (P < 0.01), weight decreased 2.2 +/‐ 3.1 kg (P < 0.01), and systolic blood pressure decreased 3.7 +/‐ 14.3 mmHg (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients who achieved glycemic control (HbA1c <=7.0%) increased from 7.0% at baseline to 27.0% during follow‐up. There was also a statistically significant decrease from baseline in body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, and the proportion of patients with microalbuminuria (P < 0.01). A higher baseline HbA1c, shorter duration of diabetes, male gender, and greater weight loss were each independently associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c (P < 0.01). Conclusions: In a real‐world clinical setting in Canada, dapagliflozin produced significant improvements in HbA1c, weight, and blood pressure in patients with T2D, comparable to that seen in randomized clinical trials.

AB: Background: Although European guideline stated that rate control medication can safely be used in patients with obstructive lung disease (OLD), there is little real‐world evidence for the rate control in patients with both AF and OLD until now. Objective: The aim for this study was to investigate clinical outcomes on each class of rate control medication with patients having AF and OLD. Methods: This study used whole claim database provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from 2002 to 2015. Risk of all‐cause mortality was compared between three drug groups by using Cox regression analysis after propensity score matching for baseline characteristics. Results: There were 5206, 4823, 4823, 4037 and 9756 patients with OLD were treated with selective beta‐blocker (BB), non‐selective BB, and calcium channel blocker (CCB), and digoxin, respectively. Total of 55,306 patients did not receive any rate‐control drug, who served as reference group. In patients with moderate to severe OLD, significant lower mortality risk were found in all four ratecontrol groups with selective BB (HR=0.75, 95% CI=0.61‐0.93), non‐selective BB (HR=0.74, 95% CI=0.71‐0.88), CCB (HR=0.82, 95% CI=0.70‐0.97), and digoxin (HR=0.83, 95% CI=0.76‐0.92), compared to the reference group. In mild OLD, the risk of mortality was lower in patients receiving selective BB, non‐selective BB and CCB (all HR<1.00, P<0.05). Conversely, the digoxin group had a higher risk of mortality in mild OLD (HR=1.03, 95% CI=1.00‐1.07). Conclusion: Rate control medications for AF conferred beneficial effect on survival in patients with moderate to severe OLD. Though selective, non‐selective BB and CCB was associated with lower mortality rate in mild OLD, digoxin use was associated with higher mortality rate. Further prospective, randomised trials are needed to confirm these findings. (Figure Presented).

AB: Introduction: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) currently represents standard of care in out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) despite the demonstration of its many side effects. To date, CPR has never been tested in a randomized, prospective clinical trial against an automated external defibrillator (AED) quick deployment, as such a trial is considered impossible for ethical reasons. Nevertheless, insights on the effective role of CPR when an AED is quickly available can be provided from the Progetto Vita of Piacenza, Italy: the first early defibrillation project established in Europe. Hypothesis: To compare differences in 13‐year survival between OOHCA victims rescued by standard care and patients rescued by AED‐only trained responders. Methods: Prospective, non‐randomized parallel study comparing mortality when rescuers only used automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and did not perform CPR with mortality from the standard Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response, including CPR. Survival was followed over 13 years, from June 2001 to July 2014. Results: In 3366 OOHCAs, survival to hospital discharge occurred in 39 of the 95 patients treated with an AED only and in 193 of the 3271 patients treated by standard EMS (41.4% vs. 5.9%; p<0.001) The Kaplan Meier estimates of survival after 13‐years follow‐up are 31.8% when AEDs only were used versus 2.4% for standard EMS response. Estimates of survival also are significantly better for Progetto Vita when survival was stratified by gender and location of cardiac arrest. Presence of a shockable rhythm at rescuers arrival was associated with a 16.8‐fold increased chance of survival to discharge. Progetto Vita intervention was independently associated with a 2.8‐fold increased chance of survival to discharge, regardless of minutes from dispatch to arrival, cardiac arrest location, rhythm presentation, and age. Conclusions: Progetto Vita demonstrates excellent long‐term survival from out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest without CPR use compared with standard resuscitation. The findings from the present study could provide solid "real‐world" evidence for the broadscale dissemination of AEDs quickly available to layperson rescuers.

AB: Objectives: In BB‐type selection bias all study groups include patients. BB can result to spurious associations and results in comparative settings. In HRQoL "burden comparisons", MGPC is often based on age and gender alone, if any. Furthermore, commonly available specialist care HRQoL data may generalize poorly to primary health care setting (PHCS) and may not include baseline values for patients entering the system. Thus, real‐world evidence (RWE) generation for HRQoL benchmarking is difficult. Our objectives were to develop MAIC, predict MGPC based on the MAIC, estimate PTB and assess UMN; all at individual PHCS level. Methods: A MAIC‐based MGPC was developed using representative Finnish general population RWE (N ~5144) to estimate MGPC HRQoL ("reference value") for unselected patients participating in Effective Health Centre Study (N= 511, three health centres, Pirkanmaa, Finland). Both studies used EQ‐5D‐3L with British preferences, and included age, sex, income, education, and comorbidities for the MAIC. PTB was estimated by subtracting the baseline EQ‐5D‐3L scores from the estimated MGPC scores. UMN (potential residual disutility) was estimated by subtracting the EQ‐5D‐3L scores at 3‐month follow‐up from the estimated MGPC scores. Results: Mean baseline EQ‐5D‐3L scores for PHCS patients and MGPC were 0.74 and 0.81, respectively, demonstrating a significant and clinically important PTB (0.07; 95%CI 0.06‐0.09), "medical need". Most patient groups demonstrated significant mean PTB. The mean PTB was highest for ICPC‐2 chapter L: Musculoskeletal and lowest for S: Skin. The mean scores at three months for PHCS patients and MGPC were 0.79 and 0.81, respectively, demonstrating an insignificant UMN of 0.02 (95%CI 0.00‐0.04). The mean UMN was highest among patients with ICPC‐2 chapter N: Neurological or for patients with asthma comorbidity. The developed MAIC‐based MGPC outperformed age‐ and sex‐matched MGPC. Conclusions: BB and all time‐specific measurements and their development can be taken into account in the MAIC‐based MGPC, PTB and UMN HRQoL benchmarking.

AB: Background/Purpose: SB4, a biosimilar to the reference ETN, received EU marketing authorisation in January 2016, based on the totality of evidence from pre‐clinical and clinical Phase I and III studies that demonstrated similar efficacy, bioequivalence, and comparable safety and immunogenicity to ETN. There are few published data on outcomes of transition from originator to biosimilar outside the controlled setting of randomised clinical trials. Objectives: Provide real world evidence on the outcomes of transition from ETN to SB4 in routine clinical practice. Methods: This ongoing observational study is designed to enrol 600 subjects with RA or axSpA, who initiated SB4 as part of routine clinical practice following a minimum of 6 months treatment with a stable dose of originator ETN, at clinics in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Data are captured from clinic records, retrospectively for 6 months prior to switch and prospectively and/or retrospectively for 6 months following switch. Outcome measures include disease score (DAS‐28 for RA, BASDAI for axSpA) over time, clinical characteristics and management, and adverse events. This interim analysis (IA) describes baseline characteristics and clinical outcome 3 months post‐initiation of SB4. Results: In this interim analysis, 255 subjects have been included: 163 with RA and 92 with axSpA, both groups possibly representing longer‐standing established disease; neither group experienced a clinically significant difference in disease score from baseline to 3 months post‐transition, with mean individual change of 0.0 (95% CI ‐0.1, 0.2) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.0, 0.9) in RA and axSpA subjects respectively. Conclusion: This IA provides a first insight into clinical outcomes in a contemporary cohort of EU patients with established RA and axSpA, transitioned from originator to biosimilar ETN in a study of clinical practice: data do not indicate loss of treatment effectiveness in the 3 months following transition. Subsequent to these preliminary data, the study will provide ongoing, pertinent information about 3‐ and 6‐month outcomes in these populations, helping to inform evidence‐based treatment decisions.

AB: Background Advances in information and communication technology supports many aspects of medical practices and clinical researches. Data collection using case report form (CRF) requires manual works and makes burden to researchers and cost. A system that assembles and manages data from different formats and multiple data sources into a centralized system, Clinical data management system (CDMS), has been introduced in Japan since 2014. Objective: To describe the function of innovative database, CDMS, and fea‐sibility of implementing and using sharable and comparable medical data for clinical research. Design/Methods CDMS, a user‐friendly, versatile, and secure network system for data and knowledge management has been assembled in Japan. CDMS for patients was introduced to outpatient department to take patient history and interview. CDMS integrates disease, laboratory data, and prescription from multiple platforms of electronic health record in each institute and patients' medical interview and history. To evaluate the feasibility of CDMS for clinical research, the observational items used in CRFs of clinical trial conducted at Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center in 2016 were sorted and the proportion of items that could theoretically be covered by CDMS was evaluated. Results: The versatile database covered everything about pediatrics from infants to child medical records. CDMS used a metadata‐driven model that contained built‐in knowledge bases to control medical terminology. Among the CRFs from 4 clinical trials, patient medical interview and history, disease, pre‐scription and laboratory data accounted for 33.0 ± 39.4 %, 0.6 ± 0.9 %, 18.6 ± 16.7 % and 21.8 ± 12.3 %, respectively. CDMS covered 73.9 ± 41.4 % of observational items in clinical research. Conclusions CDMS broadly covered the observational items in clinical research and was showed the usefulness for it. CDMS also functions as a platform to realize randomized registry trial and will reveal the real‐world evidence in clinical care, home or community settings. CDMS will change clinical research from hypothesis testing to confirming the correlation between the big data and every medical thing.

DOI: 10.1159/000492737
AB: The complaints about the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in oncology ‐ mostly Phase 3 approval studies ‐ are not stopping. The commonly‐mentioned points of criticism include study populations that do not represent real‐world patients, control interventions that do not represent current treatment standards, the use of surrogates as primary outcomes, treatment switching triggered by the study design (especially from the control to the test intervention after disease progression), and inadequate consideration of patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), including health‐related quality of life. To counter these deficits, collecting «real‐world evidence» and using these data for treatment comparisons in (added) benefit assessments is proposed. Registries are to provide the corresponding framework. Apart from the fact that clear definitions (e.g. product‐specific vs. disease registries) and standards (e.g. completeness, recording of confounding factors) are first required, regarding the suggested approach it is overlooked that none of the points mentioned above are related to the principle of the RCT itself. RCTs can also use broad inclusion criteria and PROs, treatment switching is a problem that can hardly be solved with analyses of registry data, and even less data on PROs are currently being collected in registries than in RCTs. However, it is much more serious that data from (non‐randomized) observational studies show inherent selection bias that cannot be controlled statistically due to unknown underlying mechanisms. The latter is all the more important the smaller the differences to be detected are, meaning that observational studies generally cannot be used to refute the existence of potential treatment effects. However, such an assumption ‐ a treatment effect observed in approval studies cannot be reproduced in real‐world healthcare ‐ is commonly used as an argument for the necessity of treatment comparisons in precisely this «real world». The consequences of the above factors thus cannot be to abolish the foundation of a fair treatment comparison and accept weaker designs. Rather, conjoint efforts are required from all parties seriously interested in improving the evidence base in order to design clinical studies targeted towards the information needs of patients and of stakeholders who treat patients, develop guidelines, conduct benefit assessments, and make approval or reimbursement decisions.

AB: BACKGROUND: In Belgium, the debate about the effect of the national academic detailing service (ADS) on prescribing quality in general practice is ongoing. In order to evaluate both the implementation strategies of the ADS and its effectiveness on appropriate prescribing of pain relief medication, we conducted a real‐world cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT). METHODS: In a pragmatic cRCT, all Belgian general practices previously visited by Farmaka were assessed for eligibility and randomized. Only practices randomized to the intervention group were invited for an academic detailing visit on appropriate prescribing of pain relief medication. GPs were unaware of the study, ensuring the production of real‐world evidence but were given the option to opt out from the analysis. An objective outcome assessment was obtained using routinely collected reimbursement data. Primary outcomes were the proportion of patients reimbursed for an analgesic or NSAID, the defined daily dose of paracetamol per patient per month, the proportion of patients reimbursed for a recommended NSAID among those reimbursed for any NSAID and the proportion of patients reimbursed for both an NSAID and a proton pump inhibitor among those reimbursed for an NSAID. The impact of practice, GP and academic detailer characteristics were also assessed. RESULTS: Three thousand five hundred twenty‐nine general practices (4530 GPs) were eligible and randomized. One thousand six hundred ninety‐eight practices (2171 GPs) in the intervention group and one thousand seven hundred three (2163 GPs) in the control group were included in the analysis. The intervention had a significant impact on the proportion of patients reimbursed for a recommended NSAID among those reimbursed for any NSAID (increase in odds (95% CI): 19% (10‐29%)). A clear impact on other outcomes could not be detected. Additionally, we showed that the characteristics of the academic detailers might impact the effectiveness of the visit. CONCLUSIONS: National implementation of academic detailing in Belgian general practices provided by Farmaka significantly improved the proportion of recommended NSAIDs prescribed by GPs, but not other outcomes related to appropriate prescribing of pain relief medication.

AB: OBJECTIVE The sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and canagli‐flozin reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), all‐cause mortality (ACM), and renal events in cardiovascular outcomes trials, with observational real‐world evidence suggesting class effect benefits that include dapagliflozin. We examined the placebo arm of the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) to determine whether the effects of drop‐in open‐label dapagliflozin on MACE, ACM, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were consistent with the SGLT2i class as a whole. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS SGLT2i drop‐in therapy occurred in 10.6% of EXSCEL participants, with 5.2% taking dapagliflozin. Propensity‐matched cohorts of SGLT2i users and nonusers (n = 709 per group) were generated on the basis of their characteristics before open‐label SGLT2i drop‐in or at baseline for participants taking SGLT2i at enrollment and an equivalent study visit for non‐SGLT2i users. Time to first adjudicated MACE and ACM was analyzed using Cox regression. eGFR slopes were compared between matched cohorts using a mixed‐model repeated‐measures analysis. RESULTS In adjusted analyses, SGLT2i users (compared with nonusers) had a numerically lower risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio 0.79 [95% CI 0.49–1.28]), as did dapagliflozin users (0.55 [0.26–1.15]). SGLT2i users had a significantly lower ACM risk (0.51 [0.27–0.95]; dapagliflozin: 0.66 [0.25–1.72]). Compared with nonusers, eGFR slope was significantly better for SGLT2i users overall (+1.78 [95% CI 0.87–2.69] mL/min/1.73 m2 per year) and for dapagliflozin users (+2.28 [1.01–3.54] mL/min/1.73 m2 per year). CONCLUSIONS This post hoc analysis of the placebo arm of EXSCEL supports a beneficial class effect for all SGLT2i, including dapagliflozin, for reduced ACM and less eGFR decline.

AB: Background: Secukinumab has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of psoriatic arthritis (PsA)1 and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)2 in numerous phase III studies. Still, as randomized, controlled, clinical trials often limit their patients to a very strict and selected group, further data on real world evidence is necessary to assess efficacy in a broader patient group. Objectives: To evaluate baseline characteristics regarding demographics, disease activity and comorbidities in patients with active PsA or AS in daily practice treated with secukinumab in Germany. Methods: AQUILA, a non‐interventional, multi‐center, 52‐week study enrolling 2000 patients with active PsA or AS. Patients are documented as treated in clinical practice. Here, we will report the baseline characteristics of a subgroup of 347 patients who have been enrolled in the study. At baseline patient's health status, selected comorbidities and disease history was assessed using routine parameters (among others: CRP, joint count, BASDAI). Furthermore, overall disease activity and quality of life has been documented using ASAS‐HI (AS) and PsAID‐12 item (PsA). Results: 108 AS‐ and 239 PsA‐patients were included, majority of AS patients were male, in PsA the majority was female. Previous bDMARD exposure was high in both groups, percentage of NSAID and cDMARD exposure varied (Tab). For PsA patients elevated CRP (Tab) and a high number of tender (8.4) and swollen joints (4.4) was reported. Assessed comorbidities included coronary heart disease (9.7%), stroke (2.5%), heart failure (2.9%) and depression (13.4%). Effect of PsA on patient's life at baseline was reported via PsAID‐12 item with a mean score of 5.0 (±2.2). AS patients enrolled in this trial had a high disease activity with a mean BASDAI of 5.5 (±2.0) and elevated CRP (Table). Considered comorbidities were coronary heart disease (4.6%), stroke (0%), heart failure (0.9%) and depression (12%). Patient's impairments due to AS were assessed at baseline with the ASAS‐HI, reporting a mean score of 8.1 (±3.6). Conclusions: The baseline characteristics of the population are comparable with other studies in the phase III program of secukinumab1,2. Major difference is represented by the high number of biological‐experienced patients and comorbidities. Potential differences between these real world results and previously obtained phase III results will have to be discussed to assess their impact on patients.

AB: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate payer perceptions and utilization of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) Value Assessment Framework in coverage decisions. METHODS: A double‐blinded, web‐based survey was dissemi‐nated to 57 individuals within managed care organizations, heath systems, and academic institutions in November 2016. The survey assessed payers' experience and involvement with the ICER Framework, their perceived strengths and limitations of the Framework, and the level of influence the Framework had in recent coverage decisions. RESULTS: 55 payers representing 47 organizations completed the survey. All respondents were active members of a pharmacy & therapeutics committee. The majority of payers (67%) were familiar with the ICER Framework methodology and 36% reported reviewing one or more ICER evaluations within the preceding 12 months. Few participants (11%) reported that their organization actively engaged in a prior ICER review (eg, providing public comments, meeting attendance). 51% of respondents said that ICER's recommendations had not influenced decisions, 44% noted occasional influence on decisions, and 5% said the recommendations often influenced decisions within their organization. As a whole, respondents indicated that use of real‐world evidence (60%), transparency of methodology (53%), and choice of clinical outcomes (44%) were strengths of the Framework. Limitations noted by payers included: timing of evidence reporting vis‐a‐vis decision making needs (45%), lack of stakeholder engagement (38%), and use of fixed thresholds for cost per quality‐adjusted life year and budget impact (35%). Regardless of current application, the delivers the medication in a polite way (3.96), the pharmacist answer questions in an excellent way (3.67), all pharmacists characterized with courtesy and respect (3.45), and the pharmacists had carefulness and competency skills (3.23). The lowest statements scores were the pharmacist follow up and call the about patient conditions after dispensing (1.86), the pharmacist asks about medication compliance (2.71) and the pharmacist check about medication reconciliation (2.79). CONCLUSIONS: The health‐care professional's perception about communication and counseling need to improve with emphasis on medication follow‐up, medication adherence, and medication reconciliation. Corrections of healthcare care provider'sneedswillimprovethe perceptions, the communications, and avoid the unnecessary additional cost.

AB: BACKGROUND: Alefacept has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, either as monotherapy or combined with other treatment modalities such as phototherapy. OBJECTIVE: AWARE (Amevive Wisdom Acquired from Real‐World Evidence) is a multicenter, observational, phase IV Canadian registry of psoriasis patients treated with alefacept. METHODS: Patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were treated with at least one course of alefacept, either alone or added on to their existing antipsoriatic treatment regimen. Each course of alefacept was followed by a period of at least 12 weeks off treatment. Efficacy outcomes included physicians' and patients' assessments of response at week 18, as well as change in percent body surface area (BSA) involvement with psoriasis. The time to retreatment was assessed in patients receiving a second course of alefacept during at least 60 weeks of prospective follow‐up. RESULTS: The majority of patients received alefacept in combination with other antipsoriatic therapies. Physicians' and patients' assessments of response at 18 weeks showed that 42% and 41% of patients, respectively, had a "cleared to marked response" and a further 42% had a "moderate to some response." Among those patients whose psoriasis was moderately controlled or not controlled at baseline, 49 to 51% and 33 to 36%, respectively, improved to "cleared to marked response" at 18 weeks. A substantial shift in percent BSA involvement with psoriasis was observed at 18 weeks, with 55% of patients having a BSA involvement of < 10% at week 18 compared to only 20% having this level of BSA involvement at baseline. The mean time to retreatment among the 60% of patients who received a second course of alefacept was 19.3 weeks (range 2‐47 weeks). CONCLUSION: A single course of alefacept therapy improved outcomes in this broad population of real‐world chronic plaque psoriasis patients. STUDY LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this study include its nonrandomized, noncontrolled, noncomparative design, which allowed multiple different treatment approaches across all patients. The rating scales used in this study have not been previously validated, and ranges were assigned to baseline control and response data that are not specifically defined. Clinicians did not receive specific training in using these scales; therefore, interrater variability could not be assessed.

DOI: 10.1002/pds.4629
AB: Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used to assess medication effectiveness in point of care randomised controlled trials (RCTs), driven by a need to more fully understand the risk/benefit profile, inform reimbursement decisions and cost‐efficiency. However, key study outcomes may not be readily available as discrete, easily identifiable events from routine systems, and require derivation using a complex algorithm of diagnostic/medical/drug codes. Establishing the validity of algorithms will enable the use of real‐world evidence in regulatory decision making. Objectives: To validate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation episodes derived algorithmically in an EHR against researcher‐led, prospectively captured exacerbation episodes using a case report form (CRF) from an RCT. Methods: This analysis used two data sources from COPD Salford Lung Study (SLS) (n = 2269) RCT CRF and the linked primary‐secondary care EHR. Exacerbation episodes in the EHR database, identified using an adapted published algorithm, were compared with those defined in the RCT CRF. Episode characteristics (frequency, duration) were compared, and sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) calculated. A match between EHR vs CRF episodes was defined as at least a 1‐day overlap in sensitivity analysis, the definition was relaxed to any part of an EHR episode being within 3, 7, 15, and 30 days of a CRF episode. Results: In total, 3791 EHR episodes [median length 14d minimum 14d, maximum 54d] and 4403 CRF episodes [median 7d min. 1d, max. 372d] were identified. RCT episodes with long duration (≥28 days) were not well detected by EHR. Sensitivity and PPV respectively at varying distances between episodes were: 1d overlap‐63.6 and 71.1 3d distance‐64.8 and 72.1 7d‐66.3 and 73.1 15d‐69.1 and 73.6 30d‐73.7 and 67.6. Relaxing distance between episodes defining matches up to, but not beyond 15d, increased both measures. Conclusions: In this unique analysis, derivation of exacerbation episodes via EHR compared with RCT CRF recording resulted in slightly fewer episodes, with particularly short and long CRF episodes not well captured this may be tolerable in new studies of relative COPD exacerbation rates. Performance of the EHR algorithm was acceptable, indicating that EHR derived exacerbation episodes may provide an efficient, valid method of data collection.

Mostly, however, observed event rate in patients enrolled into randomization was lower than anticipated. Hypothesis: The patients' subset who were excluded from randomization for DAPT duration might have higher risk of ischemic and bleeding events. Methods: NIPPON trial is a multi‐center randomized trial to test the non‐inferiority of 6 months DAPT compared with 18 months DAPT following NOBORI stent in terms of the net clinical benefits. A total of 3773 patients were enrolled to randomization arm. Among the screened patients, 257 were assigned to pre‐specified registry arm due to under hemodialysis, concomitant use of anticoagulation or 2 stent implantation to bifurcation lesion. Kaplan‐Meier (KM) analysis was done to estimate net adverse clinical and cerebrovascular events (NACCE) defined as the composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or major bleeding (modified Replace criteria or BARC criteria 3 or 5). Results: The KM estimated probability of the NACCE at 3 years was 29.1 % with registry arm and 5.7 % with randomized arm (P<0.0001, HR: 4.92, 95%CI: 3.49 ‐ 6.95) (Figure). All cause death was 20.0 % with registry arm and 5.7 % with randomized arm (P<0.0001, HR: 8.47, 95%CI: 5.44 ‐13.2). The incidence of stroke was also significantly different (3.3% vs. 1.3%; P=0.02, HR: 2.80, 95%CI: 1.11 ‐ 7.07). Major bleeding was 5.5 % with registry arm and 1.6 % with randomized arm (p=0.0004, HR 3.14; 95%CI: 1.60 ‐ 6.15). Conclusion: In the clinical trial assessing DAPT duration, the patients' subset who were excluded from randomization might develop higher incidence of both ischemic and bleeding events. Further clinical trials are warranted to generate real world evidence of optimal DAPT duration in each specified patient's category.

AB: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and fatal restrictive respiratory disease under the idiopathic lung disease (ILD) class. IPF is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and has more scarring, less inflammation, and poorer prognosis than most other ILD forms. Exacerbation of IPF is rapid, with unpredictable deterioration of lung function, and is associated with short‐term mortality. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) evidence‐based guidelines for diagnosis and management of IPF reports that the incidence of acute exacerbations is between 5[%]‐10[%]. Limited real‐world evidence has been identified in the United States that assesses patterns of hospitalization, exacerbation of IPF, and the associated economic burden.OBJECTIVES: To (a) characterize patients newly diagnosed with IPF and (b) examine incidence rates and costs of all‐cause hospitalizations, IPF‐related hospitalizations, and exacerbations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed with a national commercial claims database from calendar years 2006 to 2011. Newly diagnosed IPF patients were identified with either = 2 claims for idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (IFA) or = 1 claim for IFA and = 1 claim for postinflammatory pulmonary fibrosis and a lung biopsy or thoracic high‐resolution computed tomography within 90 days of the first claim for IFA (index date). IPF‐related hospitalizations and possible IPF exacerbations were defined based on diagnoses recorded on event claims. Frequency, incidence rate, duration of events, and associated costs from the third‐party payer's perspective were estimated. RESULTS: Among 1,735 identified IPF patients, 38.6[%] had at least 1 all‐cause hospitalization; 10.8[%] had IPF‐related hospitalizations; 4.6[%] had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to hospitalization; and 72.1[%] had suspected IPF exacerbations leading to urgent outpatient visits during the 1‐year post‐index period. Incident rates for these 4 events were 83 (95[%] CI = 79‐88), 17 (95[%] CI = 14‐19), 7 (95[%] CI = 6‐9), and 277 (95[%] CI = 269‐286) per 100 person‐years, respectively. Average costs per event were $13,987 (SD = $41,988), $16,812 (SD = $66,399), $14,731 (SD = $85,468), and $444 (SD = $1,481), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations and possible exacerbations among patients with IPF were costly. Appropriate management of IPF needs to be considered to help slow IPF disease progression.

AB: Introduction: Treatment of hemophilia is complicated by the development of FVIII or FIX neutralizing antibodies in ∼30% and ∼2‐5% of patients with severe hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB), respectively, which precludes the efficacious use of replacement therapy. The bypassing agents, FEIBA (activated prothrombin complex concentrates [APCC]) and recombinant FVIIa, are used in these patients. However, the time required for administration of APCC reconstituted at standard volume and at the recommended rate (2 U/ kg/min) may burden patients and clinicians. The mean infusion rate during routine clinical practice in the 'FEIBA PASS' study was 3.7 U/ kg/min (range, 0.9‐23.5). Even with a maximum rate being 12 times higher than that recommended in the SmPC of APCC (2 U/kg/min), a manual analysis of safety data did not disclose any adverse events associated with a higher infusion rate. Methods: Based on these results, and with the goal of reducing the burden of infusion, the 'FEIBA STAR' study was designed to evaluate the tolerability and safety of infusing a 50% reduced volume at standard (2 U/kg/min) and increased (4 and 10 U/kg/min) infusion rates compared with regular volume at the standard infusion rate. Adverse events, thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion‐related reactions, vital signs, and laboratory parameters will be monitored. Patient treatment preference and pre‐and post‐infusion FII levels will also be evaluated. Results: This is a 2‐part, prospective, open‐label, multicenter trial in patients with HA or HB with inhibitor titers ≥0.6 BU requiring bypassing agents. In the 2‐way cross‐over design of Part 1, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive, at the standard infusion rate (2 U/kg/min), 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted in 50% reduced volume followed by 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted at regular volume, or vice versa. In Part 2, evaluable patients (receiving 4 of 6 doses in Part 1) will sequentially receive 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted in 50% reduced volume at 4 U/kg/min followed by 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted in 50% reduced volume at 10 U/kg/min. All infusions will be given at 48‐hour intervals. Discussion/Conclusion: This study will provide real‐world evidence on the tolerability and safety of using higher infusion rates of APCC, which has the potential to reduce the burden of infusion.

AB: Introduction: Patient population as well as obstetric practice in the Netherlands may deviate from those in the USA, where the phase III study on Misodel was performed. Aim of this prospective, observational, multi‐centre, open‐label study was to retrieve 'real world evidence' about the effectiveness and safety of misoprostol 200 micrograms misoprostol vaginal delivery system (Misodel) in Dutch obstetric practice. Materials and methods: Misodel was applied in accordance with clinical routines after obtaining informed consent for (coded) use of medical chart information. Primary endpoint was the time to vaginal delivery after insertion of Misodel. Key secondary endpoints were time to any delivery, Caesarean section rate, need for oxytocin after priming, maternal/foetal/neonatal safety and experience of the treating physician. Clinical cases and summary results: Thirteen centres enrolled 106 patients, of whom 55% were nulliparous, from December 2014 till August 2015. Total vaginal delivery rate was 78%. Median time to vaginal delivery was 14.0 h, 19.1 h for nulliparous and 12.6 h for multiparous women. Incidences of a. vaginal delivery and b. vaginal delivery and Caesarean section combined within 24 h were 60.4% and 71.7% respectively. The proportion of women needing oxytocin for augmentation was 58.9% for nulliparous and 25.0% for multiparous women. The incidences of tachysystole and tachysystole with foetal heart rate involvement were 23.6 and 14.2% respectively. Tocolysis was given in 14.2% of the cases. Meconium‐stained liquor was seen in 16.0%. Two neonates had a low 5‐minute APGAR‐score and six neonates were diagnosed with metabolic acidosis (umbilical artery pH < 7.05 and base deficit > 12 mmol/l). Experience of the treating physician with Misodel regarding efficacy, safety, single dose for 24 h, controlled release, ease of insertion, possibility of retrieval and reduction in vaginal examinations scored on average 4 out of 5. Conclusion: Use of Misodel in Dutch obstetric practice resulted in a relatively high vaginal delivery rate and a short time to vaginal delivery. In the majority of multiparous patients, oxytocin augmentation was not needed. Foetal and neonatal safety warrant the cautious use of Misodel. Dutch doctors were satisfied with the use of Misodel.

AB: Background: Once‐daily fingolimod (Gilenya, Novartis Pharma AG) is a sphingosine 1‐phosphate receptor modulator approved for the treatment of relapsing MS. More than 134.000 patients have been treated with fingolimod; total patient exposure now exceeds 289.000 patient‐years. Objective: PANGAEA (Post‐Authorization Non‐interventional German sAfety of GilEnyA in RRMS patients) is a non‐interventional study (NIS), conducted in Germany, to investigate longterm safety, tolerability and effectiveness in daily clinical practice. Here we present data on effectiveness of fingolimod in daily clinical practice from patients treated for up to 4 years. Methods: PANGAEA is a prospective, multi‐center, non‐interventional, long‐term study of fingolimod for the treatment of patients with RRMS. The observation period under PANGAEA is up to 60 months with follow‐up visits every 3 months. Recruitment finished in December 2013. 4229 patients from 374 centers were enrolled. Data presented are part of an interim analysis conducted in January 2016 Results: The proportion of female patients was 71.9 % and the mean age was 39.1 (+/‐10.0) years. The mean annual relapse rate of PANGAEA patients improved from 1.5 +/‐ 0.04 (95% CI; baseline) to 0.43 +/‐ 0.02 (year 1), 0.34 +/‐ 0.03 (year 2), 0.31 +/‐ 0.03 (year 3) and 0.29 +/‐ 0.04 in year 4 of treatment. In the first year of treatment 68.5% of the patients were relapse free. This number increased to 75.5% in the fourth year. The mean baseline EDSS in PANGAEA was 3.0 (+/‐0.03; 95%CI)) and remained stable over 4 years. In each year of treatment app. 90% of the patients had a stable EDSS or experienced a 6 months confirmed EDSS improvement. In the fourth year of treatment 73.2% of the patients were free of relapses and 6 months confirmed disability progression. 42.3% of the patients neither had a relapse nor a 6 months confirmed disability progression over 4 years of treatment. Patient reported outcomes (EQ‐5D, TSQM‐9) evaluated in a substudy (n=830) over a period of 24 months confirmed the good effectiveness and convenience profile of Fingolimod from a patient point of view. Conclusions: The results of the 4 year interim analysis of PANGAEA support the positive efficacy profile in phase III clinical trials with real world evidence data.

Objective: PANGAEA (Post‐Authorization Non‐interventional German sAfety of GilEnyA in RRMS patients) is a non‐interventional study (NIS), conducted in Germany, to investigate long‐term safety, tolerability and effectiveness in daily clinical practice. PANGAEA included a subpopulation of patients treated with fingolimod in clinical trials prior to inclusion into PANGAEA. Here we presenr data on this population from first intake of fingolimod up to 4 years of Fingolimod treatment in PANGAEA. Methods: PANGAEA is a prospective, multi‐center, non‐interventional, long‐term study of fingolimod for the treatment of patients with RRMS. The observation period in PANGAEA is up to 60 months with follow‐up visits every 3 months. Recruitment into the study finished in December 2013. 4229 patients from 374 centers were enrolled. 874 patients switched from clinical trials to PANGAEA. The baseline characteristics of 498 patients in the former study patient cohort (FSC) are presented. Results: The proportion of female patients in the FSC was 74.1 % and the mean age was 38.8 (+/‐9.1) years. The mean time since diagnosis was 7.0 (+/‐5.8) years. The mean annual relapse rate (ARR) before start of fingolimod was 1.2 (+/‐1.2), and the mean EDSS was 2.4 (+/‐1.5). Prior to PANGAEA study entry these patients were pre‐treated with fingolimod for 235.4 (+/‐172.2) days. The baseline characteristics of the FSC slightly differed in comparison to patients that were fingolimod naive. From fingolimod baseline to year 4 in PANGAEA the ARR of the FSC was reduced by 78% to 0.26 +/‐ 0.05 (95% CI) and the mean EDSS remained stable over this time period. 88% had a stable or improved 6 months confirmed EDDS in year 4. 41.7% of the patients neither had a relapse nor an EDSS progression over a period of 4 years in PANGAEA. Conclusions: Baseline characteristics were different in treatmentnaive patients and those who switched to Fingolimod from clinical trials. Nevertheless the Nevertheless the effectiveness data of the FCO within PANGAEA are comparable to the patients that were treatmentnaive and support the positive efficacy profile presented in phase III clinical trials with real world evidence data.

AB: Objective: The aim of this post‐hoc analysis was to compare the results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real‐world evidence (RWE) studies of valsartan/amlodipine (Val/Aml) and valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (Val/Aml/HCTZ) in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (>140/90mmHg). Methods: Data was pooled from 15 RCTs (N=5542) and 8 RWE studies (N=1397) for Val/Aml; and 2 RCTs (N=804) and 5 RWE studies (N=9380) for Val/Aml/HCTZ. Patients who received Val/Aml (80/5, 160/5, 160/10, 320/5, or 320/10mg), Val/Aml/HCTZ (160/5/12.5, 160/5/25, 160/10/12.5, 160/10/25, or 320/10/25mg) or placebo were considered for this analysis. Only patients with both baseline and follow‐up assessment within 60‐90 days after baseline had been included in the analysis. Patients with missing values were excluded from the analysis. Using fitted linear mixed‐effects model and random factors, treatment interactions and study design with mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP), diastolic BP (msDBP) and pulse pressure (msPP) reductions from baseline to Week 8‐12 of treatment were compared. Results: Baseline demographics and patient characteristics were comparable between RCT and RWE datasets and within Val/Aml and Val/Aml/HCTZ treatment groups. In both RCT and RWE studies, least‐squares mean (LSM) reduction in msSBP/msDBP and msPP from baseline were significant (p<.05) across all dosages. The efficacy of Val/Aml in RCTs was statistically significantly greater than in RWE studies for msSBP/msDBP (‐23.1/‐13.8 vs. ‐17.9/‐9.1mmHg) but the difference was non‐significant for msPP (‐8.6 vs. ‐9.3mmHg; p=.77). For Val/Aml/HCTZ, no direct comparison was available but a similar trend was observed. The difference observed for msSBP and msDBP may be due to routine practice setting, larger populations may have more confounders and different behaviors towards treatment adherence. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that the efficacy of Val/Aml and Val/Aml/HCTZ in RCTs was more pronounced compared with their effectiveness in RWE studies in different ethnic populations although the overall benefit was not different.

PT: Conference Abstract
AB: PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The role of the triple therapy combination of a long‐acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), a long‐acting beta2‐agonist (LABA), and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a topic of debate. The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 recommends step‐up from LAMA/LABA to triple therapy if patients have further exacerbations. However, GOLD acknowledges more evidence is needed to draw conclusions on the benefits of triple therapy versus LAMA/LABA. In addition, payers and clinicians seek real‐world evidence for the pharmacologic treatment of COPD. GOAL: To generate scientifically rigorous evidence in a real‐world setting to guide clinical and budgetary decision‐making by comparing clinical and health‐care resource utilization (HCRU) outcomes of patients with COPD, randomized to the fixed‐dose combination of tiotropium and olodaterol (T/O) or triple therapy. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This 12‐month, randomized, open‐label, pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) will enroll 3200 patients across 400 community‐based physician sites. Reflecting the pragmatic design, patients will be randomized to T/O or triple therapy (1:1 ratio) following the physician's decision to escalate therapy. The minimal inclusion criteria are age >=40 years with COPD deemed by the physician to be not controlled on current therapy (LAMA or LABA, or ICS/LABA). Other than collection of baseline measures, patients will receive usual care and be followed for 12 months with both site‐level and claims data collected. The study is due to begin enrolling in Q3 2017. OBSERVATIONS: Primary endpoint is time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation. Secondary endpoints include annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations, time to first and annual rate of severe exacerbations, and proportion of patients with moderate or severe exacerbations. Safety, all‐cause and COPD‐related HCRU and costs, and the main drivers of HCRU, will also be evaluated. The primary endpoint will be analyzed on site‐level data using a Cox proportional hazards model. A sensitivity analysis will be performed for the primary endpoint by integrating site‐level and claims data. FINDINGS/RECOMMENDATIONS: The AIRWISE study is the first large‐scale U.S. PCT in COPD. The research question and endpoints directly address a pivotal clinical question put forward by GOLD 2017 and will provide much‐needed real‐world clinical and HCRU evidence for clinicians, payers, and health policy makers.

AB: Objectives: We assessed the impact of combining real‐world evidence (RWE) with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) data for overall survival (OS) extrapolations. Methods: Two RCTs in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were selected. Based on the RCT control arms, similar NSCLC and RCC populations were identified from a German claims dataset. In WinBUGS, parametric survival models were fitted on both RCTs', and two parametric models were fitted over the RWE. We performed two analyses. First, the active treatment coefficients from the RCTs' parametric survival curves were combined with the corresponding RWE parameters. Second, the RWE shape parameters were used to inform the RCTs' shape parameters. Several priors were tested. Results: The Weibull curve fitted best on both RWE datasets. In RWE, predicted mean OS was 15.5 (95%CI:13.0‐18.8) and 31.4 (95%CI:24.9‐42.5) months in NSCLC and RCC, respectively. In trials, predicted mean OS was 24.7 (95%CI:18.5‐36.2) vs 40.7 (95%CI:28.1‐61.2) months in NSCLC and 23.9 (95%CI:20.2‐28.9) vs 27.9 (95%CI:23.0‐35.2) months in RCC, in control vs active arms, respectively. In the first analysis, predicted mean RWE OS was 23.0 (95%CI:16.0‐34.3) and 37.9 (95%CI:26.8‐54.9) months in active arms of NSCLC and RCC, respectively. In the second analysis, with informative priors, the predicted mean OS was 21.9 (95%CI:17.0‐29.3) vs 34.4 (95%CI:25.4‐50.0) months in NSCLC and 24.3 (95%CI:20.7‐29.4) vs 28.5 (95%CI:23.7‐36.1) months in RCC, in control vs active arms, respectively. With very‐informative priors, the predicted mean OS was 19.3 (95%CI:15.9‐24.0) vs 28.8 (95%CI:22.5‐37.7) months in NSCLC and 25.7 (95%CI:22.0‐30.3) vs 30.8 (95%CI:25.9‐37.1) months in RCC, in control vs active arms, respectively. Conclusions: Survival in real‐world and trials may differ. This might have a significant impact on health technology assessment (HTA) outcomes as payers are most interested in real‐world effectiveness. Therefore, Bayesian methodology should be further explored for HTA purposes.

AB: Introduction: Real‐world evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is limited. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylactic regimens in Japanese patients undergoing joint replacement in a real‐world setting.Method: Overall, 1,294 patients (1,073 females and 221 males) who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 868 patients (740 females and 128 males) who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) in 34 Japanese national hospital organization (NHO) hospitals were enrolled. The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) detected by mandatory bilateral ultrasonography up to post‐operative day (POD) 10 and pulmonary embolism (PE) up to POD28. The main safety outcomes were bleeding (major or minor) and death from any cause up to POD28.Results: Patients undergoing TKA (n = 1,294) received fondaparinux (n = 360), enoxaparin (n = 223), unfractionated heparin (n = 72), anti‐platelet agents (n = 45), or no medication (n = 594). Patients undergoing THA (n = 868) received fondaparinux (n = 261), enoxaparin (n = 148), unfractionated heparin (n = 32), anti‐platelet agents (n = 44), or no medication (n = 383). The incidence rates of sonographically diagnosed DVTs up to POD10 were 24.3% in patients undergoing TKA and 12.6% in patients undergoing THA, and the incidence rates of major bleeding up to POD28 were 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively. Neither fatal bleeding nor fatal pulmonary embolism occurred. Significant risk factors for postoperative VTE identified by multivariate analysis included gender (female) in both TKA and THA groups and use of a foot pump in the TKA group. Only prophylaxis with fondaparinux reduced the occurrence of VTE significantly in both groups. Propensity score matching analysis (fondaparinux versus enoxaparin) showed that the incidence of DVT was lower (relative risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.85, P = 0.002 in TKA and relative risk 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99, P = 0.134 in THA) but that the incidence of major bleeding was higher in the fondaparinux than in the enoxaparin group (3.4% versus 0.5%, P = 0.062 in TKA and 4.9% versus 0%, P = 0.022 in THA).Conclusions: These findings indicate that prophylaxis with fondaparinux, not enoxaparin, reduces the risk of DVT but increases bleeding tendency in patients undergoing TKA and THA.Trial registration: University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry: UMIN000001366.

AB: Background: Treatment of hemophilia is complicated by the development of FVIII or FIX neutralizing antibodies in ~30% and ~2‐5% of patients with severe hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB), respectively, which precludes the efficacious use of replacement therapy. The bypassing agents, FEIBA (activated prothrombin complex concentrates [APCC]) and recombinant FVIIa, are used in these patients. However, the time required for administration of APCC reconstituted at standard volume and at the recommended rate (2 U/kg/min) may burden patients and clinicians. The mean infusion rate during routine clinical practice in the "FEIBA PASS" study was 3.7 U/kg/min (range, 0.9‐23.5). Even with A maximum rate being 12 times higher than that recommended in the prescribing information of APCC (2 U/kg/min), A manual analysis of safety data did not disclose any adverse events associated with A higher infusion rate. Objectives: Based on the above‐mentioned results, and with the goal of reducing the burden of infusion, the "FEIBA STAR" study was designed to evaluate the tolerability and safety of infusing A 50% reduced volume (5, 10, and 25 mL for APCC 500, 1000, and 2500 U, respectively) at standard (2 U/kg/min) and increased (4 and 10 U/kg/min) infusion rates compared with regular volume (10, 20, and 50 mL for APCC 500, 1000, and 2500 U, respectively) at the standard infusion rate. Methods: FEIBA STAR is A 2‐part, prospective, open‐label, multicenter trial in patients with HA or HB with inhibitor titers ≥0.6 BU requiring bypassing agents (Figure). In the 2‐way cross‐over design of Part 1, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive, at the standard infusion rate (2 U/kg/min), 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted in 50% reduced volume followed by 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted at regular volume or vice versa. In Part 2, evaluable patients (receiving 4 of 6 doses in Part 1) will sequentially receive 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted in 50% reduced volume at 4 U/kg/min followed by 3 infusions of APCC reconstituted in 50% reduced volume at 10 U/kg/min. All infusions will be given at 48‐h intervals. Adverse events, thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion‐related reactions, vital signs, and laboratory parameters will be monitored. Patient treatment preference and pre‐and post‐infusion FII levels will also be evaluated. Conclusions: This study will provide real‐world evidence on the tolerability and safety of using higher infusion rates of APCC, which has the potential to reduce the burden of infusion.

AB: Introduction: The 21‐gene Breast Recurrence Score® (RS) in the randomized NSABP B‐20, SWOG S8814, and TAILORx studies predicted chemotherapy (CT) benefit for pts with N0 and N+ disease. Endocrine therapy was not inferior to chemoendocrine therapy in 6,711 randomized TAILORx pts with RS 11‐25 and N0 disease. We characterized BCSM for the TAILORx‐defined RS groups (0‐10, 11‐15, 16‐20, 21‐25, and 26‐100) in the large population‐based SEER study of pts treated based on RS results. Methods: RS results were provided electronically to SEER registries per their linkage methods (Petkov npj Breast Cancer 2016). Eligible pts were diagnosed Jan 2004 ‐ Dec 2014 with N0 and N+(N1mic, 1‐3 positive nodes[N1]), HR+, HER2‐negative BC, and had no prior malignancy or multiple tumors, with follow‐up information through Dec 2015. BCSM estimates by reported CT use yes vs. no/unknown were computed, and must be interpreted cautiously given lack of randomization. Results: There were 80,605 pts with RS results; 70,087 with N0 disease, 4,336 with N1mic, and 6,182 with N1. Median follow‐up was 49 months, with 20,151 pts followed >76 months. 1,020 pts had experienced breast cancer death. There was a significant positive association between higher RS results and increased BCSM (p<0.001) without and with adjustment for nodal status, age, tumor size, and grade. Reported CT use increased with increasing RS result (Table). 9‐y BCSM was <4% without CT for pts with RS 0‐25 and N0 disease and for pts with RS 0‐20 and N1 disease. For RS 26‐100, 9‐y BCSM was lower with CT use than without (Table). Similar results were seen in the 4,336 pts with N1mic disease. Pts treated with CT for every RS group, as expected, tended to have higher risk features (age, tumor size and grade), and multivariable models and adjustment by propensity scores will be presented to allow for more definitive conclusions. (Table Presented) Conclusion: In both N0 and N+ disease (up to 3 positive nodes), low RS results identify more than 70% of BC patients with excellent long‐term outcomes and no apparent CT benefit, and high RS results (26‐100) identifies an important minority of patients where CT reduces BCSM. Real‐world evidence from SEER reconfirms that the 21‐gene assay is prognostic and strongly suggests it is predictive of CT benefit, irrespective of nodal status.

AB: RATIONALE: Currently, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) released a revised consensus report (GOLD 2017) which refined ABCD classification of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Moreover, some authors proposed subsequent grouping of COPD subjects into clinically meaningful phenotypes. The real‐life evolution of GOLD 2017 categories (A‐D) and clinical phenotypes during prospective follow‐up remains largely unknown. METHODS: Prospective observational data from the Czech Research Database of COPD (CMRD) were used to compare time changes of GOLD categories with the same parameter of elementary clinical COPD phenotypes. Subjects with severe COPD (FEV1<60%) enrolled in this multicentre project were assessed annualy during two years (i.e three times). We used the old (2016) and new (2017) definition of ABCD categories. Above that, patients were stratified according to predefined clinical phenotypes as: non‐exacerbators (NON‐AE), asthmaCOPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), frequent exacerbators with chronic bronchitis (AE‐CB) and without chronic bronchitis (AE NON‐CB). We used two different approach to evaluation.Firstly, we compared stable versus non‐stable categories/phenotypes. Secondly, we compared stable versus non‐stable better than baseline versus non‐stable worse than baseline categories/phenotypes. RESULTS: 784 COPD individuals (66 yrs,73% males, post‐BD FEV1 45+/‐11.6%) were enrolled until Dec 2016. 292 of them were eligible for two‐year analysis. Old and new GOLD classification spectrum consisted of A 5%, B 20%, C 5%, D 70% (GOLD 2016), respectively A 8%, B 53%, C 2%, D 37% (GOLD 2017) categories. Sixty‐two % of the population were NON‐AE, 18% were AE CB, 8% were AE NON‐CB, and 12% were ACOS subjects. Stability to non‐stability rates of both GOLD versions significantly (p< 0,001) differed from stability to non‐stability pattern of clinical phenotypes. Sixty‐five % of the phenotypes, 61% of the GOLD 2016 categories, and 44% of GOLD 2017 categogies remained stable in the three consecutive evaluations (table 1). Apparent diferences among GOLD 2016, GOLD 2017, and phenotypes stability during 2 years follow‐up were observed. There were stable (ACOS, NON‐AE, GOLD D 2016, GOLD B 2017) and unstable above mentioned sugroups in the Czech national cohort of severe COPD subjects. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that COPD phenotypes were more stable patients' attribute than GOLD categories. The worst stability was observed in case of GOLD 2017 version, only 44% of these categories were identical during long‐term evaluation. These findings brings real‐world evidence for heterogeneity description of this serious condition. (Table Presented).

YR: 2019
KY: Intracranial Thrombosis; Stroke; Tenecteplase; Thrombosis; Tissue Plasminogen Activator
AB: There are two established therapies for acute ischemic stroke, namely intravenous alteplase and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). The guiding principles behind these therapies are fast, effective and safe reperfusion of ischemic brain. Patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 4.5 hours from symptom onset are administered intravenous alteplase. If there is evidence of large vessel occlusion (LVO), these patients are transferred to the nearest comprehensive stroke center (CSC) for EVT.Physicians, hospitals and health systems are focused on implementing efficient triaging systems and workflow processes to improve speed and efficacy of administration of these life‐saving therapies. Although efforts over the years with intravenous alteplase administration has resulted in improvement in efficiency metrics like door to needle time (DTN) and door‐in‐door‐out (DIDO) time, these metrics are still not optimal, and the therapy is underutilized. Physicians continue to have concerns about low early reperfusion rates, increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and challenges with drug administration (bolus + 60‐minute infusion) with intravenous alteplase. Recent phase II trials have shown that intravenous tenecteplase is potentially safer and may achieve higher early reperfusion rates than alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Bolus administration makes tenecteplase easier to administer than alteplase (which requires infusion pumps). Transfer of patients from primary stroke centers (PSC) to comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs) is potentially easier without infusion pumps. Moreover, depending on the province, tenecteplase either costs the same, or even less, than alteplase. It is therefore possible that the use of intravenous tenecteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke otherwise eligible for intravenous alteplase may result in faster administration of thrombolysis and more efficient transport to CSCs, thus saving time, reducing adverse events (intracranial hemorrhage) and potentially improving patient outcomes, while saving the health system costs. For these various reasons, robust evidence that tenecteplase is non‐inferior to alteplase as an intravenous thrombolytic agent in patients with acute ischemic stroke will change current clinical practice as it did in patients with myocardial infarction. The proposed trial is therefore a pragmatic, registry embedded, prospective, randomized (1:1) controlled, open‐label parallel group clinical trial with blinded endpoint assessment of 1600 patients to generate real world evidence whether intravenous tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg body weight, max dose 25 mg) is non‐inferior to intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg body weight) in patients with acute ischemic stroke otherwise eligible for intravenous thrombolysis as per current standard of care.

AB: BACKGROUND: There are recognised gaps between evidence and practice in general practice, a setting which provides particular challenges for implementation. We earlier screened clinical guideline recommendations to derive a set of 'high impact' indicators based upon criteria including potential for significant patient benefit, scope for improved practice and amenability to measurement using routinely collected data. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a multifaceted, adaptable intervention package to implement four targeted, high impact recommendations in general practice. METHODS/DESIGN: The research programme Action to Support Practice Implement Research Evidence (ASPIRE) includes a pair of pragmatic cluster‐randomised trials which use a balanced incomplete block design. Clusters are general practices in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom (UK), recruited using an 'opt‐out' recruitment process. The intervention package adapted to each recommendation includes combinations of audit and feedback, educational outreach visits and computerised prompts with embedded behaviour change techniques selected on the basis of identified needs and barriers to change. In trial 1, practices are randomised to adapted interventions targeting either diabetes control or risky prescribing and those in trial 2 to adapted interventions targeting either blood pressure control in patients at risk of cardiovascular events or anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. The respective primary endpoints comprise achievement of all recommended target levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure and cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes, a composite indicator of risky prescribing, achievement of recommended blood pressure targets for specific patient groups and anticoagulation prescribing in patients with atrial fibrillation. We are also randomising practices to a fifth, non‐intervention control group to further assess Hawthorne effects. Outcomes will be assessed using routinely collected data extracted 1 year after randomisation. Economic modelling will estimate intervention cost‐effectiveness. A process evaluation involving eight non‐trial practices will examine intervention delivery, mechanisms of action and unintended consequences. DISCUSSION: ASPIRE will provide 'real‐world' evidence about the effects, cost‐effectiveness and delivery of adapted intervention packages targeting high impact recommendations. By implementing our adaptable intervention package across four distinct clinical topics, and using 'opt‐out' recruitment, our findings will provide evidence of wider generalisability.

AB: Category: Real World Evidence Background: The introduction of new disease modifying therapies (DMTs) merits estimation of their real world effectiveness compared to previously available DMTs. Objectives: This study compares persistence, adverse events, and relapse between patients with relapsing remitting multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) on IFN beta‐1a or dimethyl fumarate. Methods: A United States retrospective medical chart review of 450 randomly selected adult RRMS patients who received IFN beta‐1a or dimethyl fumarate was conducted. Patients were newly diagnosed, treatment‐naïve, and initiating first‐line treatment with IFN beta‐1a or dimethyl fumarate or previously treated, switching to IFN beta‐1a or dimethyl fumarate. Persistence was defined as being prescribed either agent, continuously, from initiation to 730 days until discontinuing medication or censored. Patient characteristics, persistence, and adverse events between treatment groups were compared using t‐tests or chi‐square tests. Kaplan‐Meier curves with log‐rank tests and Cox Proportional Hazards Models were used to compare time to non‐persistence. Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) were calculated using a robust variance Poisson model adjusting for covariates. A two‐sided alpha level of 0.05 determined statistical significance. Results: The sample was (75.8%) female with mean age 45.4 ± 12.1 years. A total of 112 patients (24.9%) became non‐persistent, with an adverse event (n=37) as the most common cause. No significant difference was observed in time to overall non‐persistency between IFN beta‐1a and dimethyl fumarate patients. Treatmentnaïve patients on IFN beta‐1a were 59% less likely (HR=0.410, 95% CI 0.169‐0.993, p=0.0483) to experience a discontinuation (no switching or restart) compared with patients on dimethyl fumarate. Non‐persistent patients on dimethyl fumarate were 5 times more likely (HR = 5.003, 95% CI 1.996‐12.54, p=0.0006) to have experienced an adverse event at a given time point. No significant difference in time to relapse or ARR between IFN beta‐1a and dimethyl fumarate treated patients were observed. Conclusion: In this real world observational study, IFN beta‐1a treated patients had comparable or more favorable persistency, adverse events, and relapse outcomes than dimethyl fumarate treated patients across two years.

AB: Background: According to current European Society of Cardiology guidelines for non‐valvular atrial fibrillation treatment, the first line drugs to prevent thromboembolic events are non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA). However, it is not clearly confirmed, how the success of NOAC approval trials (ROCKET AF (rivaroxaban), RE‐LY (dabigatran) and ARISTOTLE (apixaban)) may reflect on real‐life clinical practice. Purpose: To compare clinical characteristics of real‐life AF patients (pts) with pts included in the randomized clinical trials (ROCKET AF and RE‐LY). Methods: The analysis included 1904 pts ‐ participants of the ongoing, multicentre, retrospective CRAFT study (NCT02987062). The study is based on retrospective analysis of hospital records of AF pts treated with VKAs (acenocoumarol, warfarin) and NOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban). CHADS2 score was used for stroke risk stratification. In both trials (RE‐LY and ROCKET AF) were excluded pts with creatinine clearance <30 ml per minute while in our study was 2.9% of pts below that threshold. Results: VKA was prescribed in 341 (17.9%), while NOAC in 1563 (82.1%) (including dabigatran ‐ 506 (26.6%) and rivaroxaban ‐ 1057 (55.5%)) of the 1904 pts. VKA pts in the CRAFT study were at intermediate risk of stroke (CHADS2 2.6±1.2) between VKA population from the RE‐LY (2.1±1.1; p<0.001) and the ROCKET‐AF (3.5±1.0; p<0.001). Pts in the CRAFT study treated with NOAC (CHADS2 for dabigatran pts ‐ 1.8±1.3 and rivaroxaban pts‐ 2.2±1.4) had similar risk to pts from the RE‐LY (2.2±1.2; p=0.92) and had lower risk than pts from the ROCKET AF (3.5±0.9; p<0.001). Conclusions: The current analysis from the CRAFT study showed that real‐world pts demonstrated a distinct clinical profile from population from the RE‐LY and the ROCKET AF. In terms of stroke risk stratification, real‐life pts were more similar to pts included in the RE‐LY than in the ROCKET AF trial, which is consistent with phase IV study and real‐world evidence for rivaroxaban (XANTUS, REVISIT‐US), where the mean CHADS2 score was 2.0 and 1.9 respectively.

AB: Background/Introduction: Currently, the American and European guidelines recommend combining two out of the following three classes of drug, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin‐receptor blocker (A), calcium antagonist (C) and thiazide diuretics (D), for initial combination treatment in high risk hypertension patients. However, the real‐world evidence of head‐to‐head comparison among the recommended regimens is still limited. Purpose: We aim to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of combination regimens between patients initiating antihypertensive treatment. Methods: From Korea National Health Insurance sample cohort database, we identified eligible patients without previous history of cardiovascular disease who were started on and received prescription of dual anti‐hypertensive treatment for more than 180 days between 2003 and 2012. The patients were matched for each comparison set by means of a high‐dimensional propensity score matching (HdPS) algorithm to compare the efficacy of A + D vs A + C, A+D vs C+D, and A+C vs C+D combination treatment. Primary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)‐a composite of all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. Cardiovascular (CV) mortality and the individual components of the primary endpoint comprised the secondary end points. Results: Total of 14098 patients were identified to meet eligible criteria with follow‐up duration of 5.31+/‐3.12 years. Among them, 4109, 2235 and 1646 patients were allocated to A + D vs A + C, A+D vs C+D, and A+C vs C+D group, respectively. There was no significance difference in the primary endpoint between groups: A+D vs A+C (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76‐1.04), A+D vs C+D (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74‐1.03), and A+C vs C+D (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79‐1.15). All three recommended regimens had similar efficacy in secondary endpoints (all P>0.05). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first real‐world comparative effectiveness research comparing the recommended regimens of dual combination treatment in patient initiating antihypertensive medication. The results suggest that there is no significant difference of MACCE among recommended dual combination treatment regimens.

AB: Background: Cardiovascular (CV) disease remains a significant public health concern in the Japanese population. Evidence from clinical practice (real‐world evidence) describing treatment patterns in patients with CV disease can help identify gaps and guide efforts to improve patient outcomes. Purpose: To describe statin use and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels across three cohorts in Japan. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of three adult (>=18 years) patient groups in the JMDC medical and pharmacy claims database: (1) patients with diagnosed hypercholesterolemia, (2) patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, and (3) statin users. The first date a patient met the inclusion criteria for any of the cohorts in 2014 was assigned as the index date; cohorts were not mutually exclusive. We used one‐year baseline and follow‐up periods. Statin use was defined as having at 1+ prescription with >=14 days' supply during baseline. Statin intensity dosage categories were adapted from the U.S. AHA/ACC 2013 Guidelines as maximum tolerated, greater than moderate, moderate, and low intensity. The highest dose was used if multiple prescription claims were found. Results: We identified 51,226 patients with diagnosed hypercholesterolemia, 10,673 patients with an MI/stroke, and 59,399 statin users. The majority were male (62% hypercholesterolemia 68% MI/stroke, and 63% statin users, respectively), and the average ages were 54, 58, and 56 years, respectively. Statin use was less prevalent in the MI/stroke cohort (47%) than among hypercholesterolemia patients (72%), with only 3% of patients taking statin and ezetimibe concomitantly (all cohorts). Overall, moderate intensity statin use was most prevalent. Use of maximally tolerated statin dose was very low (1‐2%). When considered within ACC/AHA guideline definition, many (55‐62%) would be categorized as taking low intensity statins and <1% of all patients would be considered as taking high intensity or maximally tolerated statins. Among patients with an LDL‐C lab value during baseline (53‐64%), 79%, 68%, 77% had LDL‐C levels >=100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), respectively. In all cohorts, LDLC levels were lower among patients receiving higher intensity statin dose. Among the small number of patients taking concomitant statin+ezetimibe, fewer patients had LDL >=100mg/dL (43‐62%). Conclusions: Japanese guidelines recommend treating patients with lipidlowering medications to LDL‐C levels <100 mg/dL but in clinical practice fewer than 50% of patients achieve that, identifying an area for potential improvement. Future research will describe rates of cardiovascular events in these real‐world Japanese patient populations.

AB: Background: Apixaban has two dose regimens for non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients: 5mg twice daily (BID) and 2.5mg BID, with the latter indicated only for patients who meet at least 2 of 3 criteria (age >=80 years, body weight <=60kg, and serum creatinine >=1.5mg/dL). Limited ?real‐world? evidence exists on the effectiveness and safety of apixaban according to its dosage. Purpose: To compare the incidences of stroke/systemic embolism (S/SE) and major bleeding (MB) between standard dose/lower dose apixaban and warfarin in NVAF patients. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using 4 US claims databases: Optum, MarketScan, PharMetrics, and Humana. NVAF patients who initiated apixaban or warfarin from 01JAN2013‐30SEP2015 were included. After 1:1 propensity score matching (standard‐dose apixaban‐warfarin and lower‐dose apixaban‐warfarin) within each database, the resulting patient records were pooled. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios of S/SE and MB (identified by first listed inpatient diagnosis) within 1 year of therapy initiation. Results: A total of 31,827 standard‐dose apixaban‐warfarin and 6,600 lowerdose apixaban‐warfarin matched pairs were included with a mean follow‐up of 6 months. The baseline characteristics were balanced, except for age in the lowerdose population, which was adjusted for in the Cox model. The two dosages were associated with markedly different patient characteristics. Lower‐dose apixaban patients were older, had higher CHA2DS2‐VASc and HAS‐BLED scores, and were more than twice as likely to have renal disease compared to standarddose apixaban patients (Table). Standard‐dose and lower‐dose apixaban patients were associated with lower risks of S/SE and MB compared to matched warfarin patients (Figure). Conclusions: In this ?real‐world? study, standard‐dose and lower‐dose apixaban were observed to be used in two subgroups of patients who differed widely in age and clinical characteristics. Although it cannot be ascertained from claims data whether dose selection matches indicated criteria, increased age and renal disease in the lower dose group are consistent with the criteria. The results indicate that each dose of apixaban is associated with improved outcomes in the distinct population for which it is currently being prescribed.

AB: Biosimilars represent a new opportunity for lowering the cost of treatment with biological disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Studies have demonstrated large inequities in the access to bDMARDs across countries and this inequity is related to economic parameters such as gross domestic product. Thus, reduced costs of bDMARDs should potentially lead to better treatment for more patients, especially in countries with low economy. The regulatory agencies in Europe and in US have set up strict guidelines for approval of biosimilars which include extensive pre‐clinical examinations (structure and functional characteristics) but less clinical data than for an originator product. The clinical part of this comparability exercise focuses on efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics as well as immunogenicity. Three biosimilars to adalimumab have also been approved but the patent of the reference product has not yet expired (expected to occur October 2018). (expected to occur October 2018). It is a growing acceptance about the use of these biosimilars, also in extrapolated indications when treatment are started or changed for medical reasons. Most rheumatologists will consider the biosimilars on the same level as originator products in these situations. However, replacing an originator product by a biosimilar is more controversial, but is important because of the large cost‐savings. Switching evidence is available from four different types of studies which will be discussed: •Extension of phase 3 RCTs •Switching within RCTs •Real life data (eg from DANBIO) •Randomising patients on stable long‐term treatment In the NOR‐SWITCH trial ‐ totally funded by the Norwegian government ‐ 482 patients on stable treatment with the reference product infliximab across 6 indications (RA, SpA, PsA, UC, CD, PsO) were randomised to continued treatment with the reference product or switch to the biosimilar CT‐P13; Jørgensen KK et al. Lancet 2017389:2304‐2316). The primary endpoint was occurrence of disease worsening, defined by the disease‐specific composite measures or clinically significant worsening leading to a major change in treatment. Overall, disease worsening occurred in 26.2% of patients who continued treatment with the originator infliximab and in 29.6% of patients who switched to CT‐13. The adjusted treatment difference (95% CI) was ‐4.4% (‐12.7‐3.9) which was within the prespecified non‐inferiority margin of ‐15%. The occurrence of adverse events, including infusion reactions, was similar across both groups. There were no differences between the two groups in secondary endpoints, including time to study drug discontinuation, remission rates, CRP levels, anti‐drug antibody formation and drug trough levels. The extension study (not yet published) showed that switching from originator to biosimilar was not inferior to continued treatment with the biosimilar. In conclusion, the NOR‐SWITCH study demonstrated that switching to CT‐P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with originator infliximab, adding to the increasing real‐world evidence that switching from originator to biosimilar bDMARD is safe and efficacious.

AB: Introduction: Approximately one‐third of patients who experience stroke, 60% with severe MS and 75% with physical disability after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), develop spasticity that necessitates treatment.1 Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) is used in adult upper limb (AUL) spasticity, with the aim of improving function and preventing or delaying musculoskeletal complications or bone deformities. The objective of this research was to assess economic costs associated with BoNTA treatment of adult patients with AUL spasticity in a real‐life setting in France. Methods: This was a pharmacoeconomic analysis comparing annual treatment costs of AUL spasticity with different BoNTAs: abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®; aboBoNTA), onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®; onaBoNTA), and incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®; incoBoNTA). The analysis considered BoNTA unit costs, injection intervals, and dosing data. Unit costs were estimated from retail prices (2018), without commercial offer. Average BoNTA injection interval was estimated from published real‐world evidence.2 Doses of BoNTAs of interest were estimated as real‐life average administered doses based on practice‐specific market research. BoNTA products have noninterchangeable potency units. Results: Real‐life average administered doses per injection were aboBoNTA=463 U (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 413, 513), onaBoNTA=223 U (95% CI 195, 251), and incoBoNTA=207 U (95% CI 178, 236). Applying estimated unit costs, the cost per injection was aboBoNTA=€259.2, onaBoNTA, and incoBoNTA=€529.6. Accounting for BoNTA injection intervals (22, 19, and 17 weeks for aboBoNTA, onaBoNTA, and incoBoNTA, respectively,3 overall annual injection cost per patient was aboBoNTA=€614.0, onaBoNTA=€1,453.5, and incoBoNTA=€1,624.5. The estimated annual treatment cost with aboBoNTA was therefore 2.4 times lower than with onaBoNTA and 2.6 times lower than with incoBoNTA in the average administered‐doses scenario. Conclusions: Considering administered doses, treating AUL spasticity with aboBoNTA appears cost saving compared with alternative treatment options (onaBoNTA or incoBoNTA). This can be explained by both aboBoNTA unit costs and a long duration of response4 associated with less frequent reinjections.

AB: Introduction: Recently, nivolumab and cabozantinib have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) in patients who have received prior anti‐angiogenic therapy such as pazopanib or sunitinib. Both therapies are expected to be primarily used as second‐line therapy; phase 2 CABOSUN trial is assessing PFS of cabozantinib as first‐line therapy relative to sunitinib. The aRCC treatment landscape is evolving with several therapies available for aRCC patients in second‐line. Through use of a physician survey, this study assessed the evolving treatment landscape and treatment preferences in aRCC and investigated characteristics of physicians and patients who use nivolumab and cabozantinib. Methods: In August 2016, 150 oncologists in the US were recruited from a nationwide panel to complete an online questionnaire based on their practice, experience, and opinion. The study sponsor and authors were not involved in the selection of physicians, and physicians were blinded to the identity of the study sponsor. To participate, oncologists must have (1) treated at least three patients with aRCC in the past 12 months and; (2) had experience caring for at least one patient with aRCC receiving nivolumab or cabozantinib outside of a clinical trial setting in the past 12 months. Physician characteristics and preferences for the first‐, second‐, and third‐line treatment of aRCC (both currently and 6 months prior to administering the survey) were assessed. In addition, disease characteristics of patients at initiation of nivolumab or cabozantinib, physician prescribing considerations, and treatments before and after nivolumab and cabozantinib were characterized. Results: The participating oncologists treated an average of 37 aRCC patients in the past 12 months. Currently, in the firstline, physicians prescribed pazopanib most commonly (43%), followed by sunitinib (35%); in the second‐line, physicians preferred nivolumab (63%), followed by everolimus (9%) and cabozantinib (9%); in the third‐line, physicians commonly prescribed cabozantinib (23%), nivolumab (22%), axitinib (17%), and everolimus (15%). The most typical nivolumab and cabozantinib treatment duration is 4‐ 8 months, and the most common reason for treatment discontinuation is disease progression. Efficacy (OS and PFS) in clinical trials and treatment guidelines are among the most commonly selected reasons for prescribing nivolumab and cabozantinib. Most typical treatments before and after nivolumab and cabozantinib are summarized in Table 1. Conclusions: This US physician survey showed that pazopanib remains the most commonly prescribed first‐line therapy for aRCC. Treatment patterns in later lines of therapy are changing rapidly due to the newly approved therapies. Currently, nivolumab and cabozantinib are both commonly prescribed in second‐ and thirdline. The majorities of nivolumab‐ and cabozantinib‐treated patients discontinue their treatment within 8 months and need to receive subsequent line(s) of therapy, where everolimus and axitinib are commonly used. Everolimus also remains as a relevant treatment option for some physicians in the second‐line. Further studies on patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and real‐word treatment outcomes are needed to generate real‐world evidence of newer agents and treatment sequences for the treatment of aRCC.

AB: Background/Purpose: AWARE (Comparative and Pragmatic Study of Golimumab IV Versus Infliximab in Rheumatoid Arthritis) is a Phase 4 comparator study designed to provide a real‐world evidence (RWE) based assessment of intravenous golimumab (G‐IV) and infliximab (IFX) in patients (pts) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Assessments include medical history, RA disease history, prior biologic RA therapies, clinical outcomes, infusion reactions, cost effectiveness, and safety. Here we report on prior biologic use patterns of an early cohort of AWARE pts. Methods: This is a prospective, noninterventional, observational multicenter study being conducted in the United States, with 2‐year study enrollment period and 3‐year study duration. 1,200 adult RA pts will be enrolled to initiate treatment with either G‐IV or IFX. All treatment decisions are made at the discretion of the treating rheumatologist; patient (pt) visits occur as per usual clinical practice. The primary objective is to compare the proportion of pts with an infusion reaction in RA pts treated with G‐IV vs IFX. Secondary objectives include effectiveness assessments, cost effectiveness and patient reported outcomes (PROMIS‐29, Pain Interference SF6b, Fatigue SF7a, SF36) and a novel Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication‐Intravenous, which assesses patient satisfaction with an infusion therapy. Results: Mean (+/‐SD) age of pts (n=114) was 59.7 (+/‐12.02) years, with a mean body weight of 85.95 kg, 82.5% of pts were female. A total of 74 pts were administered G‐IV and 40 pts were administered IFX. Overall, 69.0% of pts reported to have received at least 1 biologic prior to enrolling. Proportion of bionaive patients among G‐IV users and IFX users were 23.3% and 45.0%, respectively. Concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use was reported in 54.1% of G‐IV pts and 70.0% of IFX pts. Among all non‐bionaive pts, the most frequently used biologic was adalimumab (31.6%). A similar proportion of G‐IV and IFX pts had prior adalimumab (32.4% and 30.0%, respectively), prior etanercept was reported in 29.7% of G‐IV pts and 10.0% of IFX pts. Of the G‐IV pts, 39.2% had prior exposure to IFX, and 15.0% of IFX pts had prior exposure to G‐IV. Subcutaneous golimumab was used in 5.0% of IFX pts, and 2.7% of the G‐IV pts. Abatacept was previously used in 18.9% of G‐IV pts and 0% of IFX pts. 10.8% of G‐IV pts had prior exposure to tocilizumab, 2.5% of IFX pts had prior exposure to that drug. Baseline CDAI scores were 33.67 (+/‐14.8) in G‐IV pts and 35.14 (+/‐16.1) in IFX pts. Conclusion: In this Phase 4 study, early evaluation of patient demographics confirms published data of current patients treated with biologic agents who have RA. Early analysis of previous biologic use in this RWE study exploring potential differences between G‐IV and IFX, indicates that there may be differences in the extent of prior biologic experience of pts treated with either one of these drugs. Patients started on G‐IV appeared to have had more extensive prior biologic experience and less concomitant MTX use compared to IFX pts. Greater MTX use by IFX pts may be related to the greater proportion of bionaive pts in the IFX group. Such differences may have relevance in terms of ultimate efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness in managing RA pts.

AB: Background: Apremilast (APR) has been studied extensively in phase III randomised, controlled trials. However, there is a lack of real‐world evidence of effectiveness and safety in a broad population of pts with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Objectives: To assess effectiveness and safety of APR in pts with active PsA from routine clinical practice settings in Germany. Methods: In this multicentre, prospective, non‐interventional study, the primary endpoint was the proportion of pts reaching ≥1 point (≥20%) improvement from baseline (BL) in the Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PhGA) score. Other endpoints included effects on tender and swollen joint counts, psoriasis‐affected body surface area (BSA), enthesitis, dactylitis, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity score (PtGA), Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease tool (PsAID), pain and pruritus. The current analysis is based on observed data. Results: The first 202 of a planned 500 German pts receiving APR for ≥4 month (≥1 month [V1],≥4 month [V2]) and 127 pts receiving APR for ≥7 months (V3) were evaluated. Mean age was 54 years, mean BMI was 29 kg/m2 and 61% were female. The mean duration of psoriasis was 25 years and of PsA was 18 years; 30% of pts were biologic‐experienced. The mean (SD) PhGA was 2.5 (0.56) at BL. After V1, 60% of pts achieved ≥1 point improvement in PhGA, which increased to 76% (V2) and 87% (V3). Mean (SD) PhGA decreased to 1.7 (0.69), 1.4 (0.73) and 1.1 (0.74) at V1, V2, and V3 respectively. Achievement of a PhGA of 0‐1 increased from 0% of pts at BL to 36.8% (V1), 65.0% (V2) and 77.2% (V3). Median improvements in tender and swollen joint counts from BL to V3 were 57.1% and 60.0%, respectively. BSA improved from 11.4% at BL to 8.3%, 5.1% and 3.5% at V1, V2 and V3, respectively. At BL, 48.4% of pts had enthesitis based on Leeds Enthesitis Index; 46% reached a score of 0 by V1, 57% by V2% and 60% by V3. At BL, 27.3% of pts had dactylitis; a score of 0 was achieved by 40.0%, 66.7% and 71.9% of pts by V1, V2, and V3, respectively. BL mean PsAID score (5.33; max=10.00) decreased to 4.40 (V1), 3.85 (V2) and 3.36 (V3). Improvements were also seen in PtGA, overall pain and pruritus. A sub‐analysis suggests that APR was associated with greater benefits in biologic‐naive pts compared with pts who previously received biologic therapies. The observed safety and tolerability after V3 was consistent with the known overall safety profile of APR. Common AEs in clinical trials were similar, with a lower incidence: diarrhoea (10.4%), nausea (5.6%), headache (4.0%), and respiratory tract infection (1.2%). Conclusions: The first results from this real‐world PsA study reinforce findings from previous clinical trials of APR. In pts with ≥4 and≥7 months of follow‐up, APR was associated with improvements in both physician‐assessed and patientreported outcomes, with possibly a greater benefit in biologic‐naïve compared with biologic‐experienced pts. Safety and tolerability were similar to the known profile of APR.

DOI: 10.1007/s00125-017-4350-z
AB: Background and aims: The “treat‐to‐target” approach is a key paradigm in clinical development of novel insulins. Typically, an investigational product and a comparator insulin are titrated aggressively to a predefined uniform glycaemic target over a period of 6 to 12 months, during which safety and efficacy parameters are assessed. However, the glycaemic target used in a treat‐to‐target trial is almost invariably lower than that commonly used in daily clinical practice, and titration of insulin to reach said target is more aggressive. This meta‐analysis was conducted in order to generate a better understanding of potential differences between treatto‐ target trials and clinical practice in terms of glycaemic outcomes and insulin dosing. Materials and methods: A Medline search was conducted focusing on identifying observational studies or real world evidence collected on glargine users. Glycaemic outcomes (HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG)) as well as insulin doses were recorded and a trial‐level metaanalysis was conducted. Similarly, phase III treat‐to‐target trials of novel insulins (degludec, glargine U300 and LY2605541) were meta‐analysed separately. Only trials and English language publications including insulin‐ naïve patients starting treatment with insulin glargine with a follow‐up period of 3 to 12 months were included. Results: A total of 207 publications were identified for analysis. After exclusion of irrelevant publications and publications lacking data on the key outcomes, 24 publications encompassing a total of 34,648 patients were included in the meta‐analysis. The average HbA1c and FPG achieved at the end of the treat‐to‐target trials in which patients were treated with glargine was 7.12% (54.3 mmol/mol) and 6.4 mmol/l, and the average insulin dose was 0.49 U/kg/day. These outcomes were significantly different from those achieved in the publications based on real world clinical practice, where HbA1c and FPG at end of follow‐up was 7.45% (57.9 mmol/mol) and 7.2 mmol/l and the average daily insulin dose was 0.21 U/kg/day. Conclusion: There are significant and important differences between treat‐to‐target trials and everyday clinical practice. Patients in treat‐totarget trials typically achieve better glycaemic outcomes, but this metaanalysis indicates that the difference may be less pronounced than might have been expected. Furthermore, the improvement in glycaemia should be viewed in the context of a significantly greater amount of basal insulin. The safety and efficacy characteristics of basal insulins in everyday clinical practice may not be readily extrapolated from treat‐to‐target trials because of differences in insulin dosing and glycaemic outcomes. In order to better understand insulin characteristics in everyday clinical practice, we suggest that drug developers and regulators work together to promote the use of pragmatic randomized insulin trials (PRINT). Combined with evidence from clamp studies and treat‐to‐target trials, PRINTs would potentially contribute important information to facilitate clinical decision making.

AB: Background: Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory medication with clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory and treatment naive multiple myeloma (MM), 5q‐myelodysplasia and lymphoma. Lenalidomide is eliminated predominantly unchanged by urinary excretion. Renal impairment is common in MM (15‐40%) and approximately 10%of MM requires dialysis. However, there is a paucity of clinical safety data of Lenalidomide in ESRF. There is evidence that Lenalidomide can be safely used in patients with moderate and severe renal dysfunction with dose adjustment. However, published data in hemodialysis‐dependent patients is limited to a handful of patients across small retrospective analyses and case reports. Patients with ESRF have generally been excluded from clinical trials investigating Lenalidomide. Phase III trials in the relapsed setting (MM‐009, MM‐010) excluded patients with a serum creatinine >221mumol/L. The FIRST trial (MM‐020), investigating upfront use, excluded patients dependent on dialysis. There is no accepted clinical standard on the most appropriate dosing of Lenalidomide in dialysis. The manufacturer has provided guidelines, being 5mg daily, day 1‐21, every 28 days (equivalent to 105mg per cycle). There is alternate well‐cited pharmacological data that the more appropriate starting dose is likely 15mg, three times per week, given post‐dialysis (equivalent to 135mg per cycle). Aims: To provide real‐world evidence of an institutional experience of the use of Lenalidomide in dialysis‐dependent MM. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit of our in‐centre experience with treating dialysis‐dependent MM with Lenalidomide and included patients who completed at least one cycle of therapy. Patients were assessed for haematological toxicity, significant infective complications, thrombosis, disease response and progression‐free survival. Best response was stratified by IMWG criteria. Patients' baseline characteristics, prior therapies, cytogenetics and FISH data were collected. Results: We identified 5 patients treated between 2010 and 2017, aged between 54 to 73 years old. All patients had relapsed/refractory MM and dialysis dependent ESRF. The median number of prior therapies was two. One patient had t(11,14) on FISH and died from progressive disease. Dose schedules are shown in the Table 1. Almost all patients experienced grade III‐IV haematological toxicity and 60%had grade III‐IV infection. There was a positive correlation between dose and toxicity, and furthermore there appeared to be an inverse relationship between age and tolerated dose. Haematological toxicities and infection were ameliorated by dose adjustment in most instances. There was no drug related mortality, however one patient died of progressive disease. Four of the five patients were prescribed aspirin thromboprophylaxis, with no proven thrombotic complications seen. Where possible to assess, the ORR was 75%(3/4), with 2 patients achieving a very good partial response (VGPR), 1 partial response and 1 progressive disease. The lowest starting dose in this cohort was 10mg twice/week and the maximum dose was 25 mg three times/week.(Table presented) Summary/Conclusions: Our experience builds on the emerging evidence that reduced dose of Lenalidomide can be safely prescribed for dialysis‐dependent MM, with clinical efficacy. In our cohort most patients took Lenalidomide on days of dialysis only. There was significant variation of dose‐related tolerability between patients. However, toxicity was manageable with diligent monitoring and dose adjustment.

AB: Introduction: Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses unique challenges in the rapidly growing elderly patient population due to age‐related morbidity and mortality. There is limited real world evidence on DPP‐4 inhibitors in elderly T2DM patients in Greece. This study evaluates the effectiveness and tolerability of vildagliptin in addition to metformin in elderly patientswithT2DM in Greece. Methods:This was a multicenter observational study with duration of 12‐14 weeks. Data recording was completed in two visits (Day 1, Week 12‐14/end of study). Patients aged >70 years with a diagnosis of T2DM who have, within the previous 2 weeks, been prescribed vildagliptin as add on to metformin therapy or sulfonylurea on top of metformin monotherapy, or T2DM patients inadequately controlled HbA1c >7.0% and <9.0% on stable doses of metformin monotherapy for at least 3 months prior to entering the study, were recruited. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment with vildagliptin in addition to metformin or vildagliptin plus metformin single pill combination. Secondary assessments included proportion of patients reaching the glycemic target of HbA1c <7.0% and <6.5%, change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body mass index (BMI), safety and tolerability, estimation of the incidence rate of confirmed hypoglycemic events and description of the demographic characteristics of the patient population. To assess the incidence rate of confirmed hypoglycemic events, a descriptive control arm of patients who recently initiated sulfonylurea on metformin monotherapy was also exploited. Results: Of the total of 336 patients at study entry, 50.3% of patients were men, mean age (+/‐ SD) was 75.9 +/‐ 4.8 years, mean BMI 28.5 +/‐ 4.1 kg/m2, mean baseline HbA1c 7.9 +/‐ 0.5% and mean FPG 167.8 +/‐ 33.1 mg/dl. For the 285 patients receiving vildagliptin and metformin (245 receiving a fixed combination and 40 receiving a free combination), the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 weeks was ‐0.97% (95% CI ‐1.04, ‐0.91), mean change in FPG was ‐42.8 mg/dl (95% CI ‐46.4, ‐39.3) and mean change in BMI was ‐0.69 kg/m2(95% CI ‐0.81, ‐0.57); p<0.0001 in all cases. Overall, 55.6% of patients reached HbA1c <7.0% and 20.4% reached HbA1c <6.5%. Overall, two patients reported three adverse events namely, lung infection, hyperpyrexia and constipation; according to the investigator these were not related to the drug. Hypoglycemia occurred in 3 (1.2%) patients receiving vildagliptin and metformin. Conclusions: Vildagliptin in combination with metformin showed improved glycemic control in daily clinical practice in elderly Greek patients with no increased incidence of adverse events.

AB: Introduction: Real world evidence studies provide critical information to supplement clinical trial data. This study compared stroke‐ and bleed‐related HCRU among NVAF patients newly treated with dabigatran, warfarin or rivaroxaban. Purpose: Compare stroke‐ and bleed‐related HCRU between dabigatran and rivaroxaban, and between dabigatran and warfarin. Methods: Adult NVAF patients newly diagnosed and newly treated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban or warfarin during 10/01/2010‐12/31/2014 were identified using MarketScan claims databases. Patients were continuously enrolled for 12 months prior to index date (first OAC claim) and followed until medication switch, discontinuation, inpatient death or end of data (12/31/2015). Dabigatran patients were 1:1 matched to rivaroxaban patients and to warfarin patients. Stroke or bleedrelated HCRU were identified based on diagnosis for stroke or bleed in the primary position. Incidence rate (IR) per 100 person‐years, 95% confidence interval (CI) and stroke and bleed related per‐patient per month (PPPM) HCRU are reported. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for risk of stroke and bleed were estimated with Cox regression. Results: A total of 26,646 and 33,024 dabigatran patients were matched to rivaroxaban and warfarin patients, respectively (mean age 68 years; 37% female in each matched group). Incidence of stroke was similar for dabigatran and rivaroxaban [IR: 0.87 (0.72‐1.02) vs. 0.86 (0.71‐1.01)] but incidence of bleed was lower in dabigatran patients compared to rivaroxaban [IR: 1.90 (1.68‐2.13) vs. 2.66 (2.41‐2.92)]. Risk of first stroke was similar between dabigatran and rivaroxaban [HR: 0.96 (0.75‐1.23), p=0.749] but bleed was significantly lower for dabigatran [HR: 0.74 (0.63‐0.86), p<0.001]. Compared to rivaroxaban, dabigatran patients had similar stroke‐related hospitalizations (0.002 PPPM for both, p=0.753) and outpatient visits (0.038 vs. 0.029, p=0.063) but significantly lower bleed‐related hospitalizations (0.004 vs. 0.005 PPPM, p=0.015) and outpatient visits (0.101 vs. 0.142, p<0.001). Incidence of stroke [IR: (0.85 (0.71‐0.98) vs. 1.25 (1.09‐1.41)) and bleed (IR: 2.03 (1.83‐2.24) vs. 2.82 (2.58‐3.07))] was lower in dabigatran compared to warfarin patients. Risk was significantly lower for first stroke and bleed in dabigatran [HR: 0.74 (0.60‐0.91)] and HR: 0.73 (0.64‐0.83), p<0.01 for both values], respectively. Compared to warfarin, dabigatran patients had sig‐ nificantly lower stroke‐related PPPM hospitalizations (0.001 vs. 0.002, p=0.046) and outpatient visits (0.034 vs. 0.046, p=0.002) and similar bleed‐related PPPM hospitalizations (0.004 for both, p=0.137) and outpatient visits (0.103 vs. 0.097, p=0.280). Conclusion: Compared to rivaroxaban, dabigatran patients had similar risk of stroke and stroke‐related HCRU but lower risk of bleed and bleed‐related HCRU. Compared to warfarin, dabigatran patients had lower risk of stroke and lower stroke‐related HCRU and lower risk of bleed but similar HCRU.

AB: SESSION TITLE: Allergy and Airway SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/10/2018 01:00 PM ‐ 02:00 PM PURPOSE: Breo Ellipta, a once daily fixed‐dose combination of the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fluticasone furoate and the long‐acting bronchodilator (LABA) vilanterol (FF/VI), was approved for reimbursement in Canada in 2015 for asthma in adults, based on a cost‐minimization analysis. New evidence from a Phase III multi‐center, open‐label randomized controlled trial set in everyday clinical practice, the Salford Lung Study (SLS) in asthma (n=4,233), demonstrates superior effectiveness for initiating FF/VI relative to continuing usual care. Primary endpoint at 24‐weeks showed significantly more patients initiated on FF/VI achieved improvement in asthma control (assessed by the Asthma Control Test) compared to patients who continued usual care. Given this new information on the relative effectiveness of treatments, an updated cost‐utility analysis of FF/VI for the treatment of asthma in Canada was conducted. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model with states for each level of asthma control (well, partially, or uncontrolled), was constructed using SLS data, based on a post‐hoc analysis of cumulative ordered logistic and negative binomial regression (adjusting for planned therapy), for asthma control and exacerbation rates respectively. FF/VI was compared to an overall usual care based on effectiveness results from SLS, with the cost of usual care in Canada calculated as a weighted average based on market share using RxDynamics data. Health‐related quality‐of‐life and health state costs were taken from published sources. Cost‐effectiveness was modelled over the 52‐week period of the SLS and extrapolated to 10‐years, assuming continued asthma control consistent with the SLS study's final data cut. RESULTS: In the first year, patients initiating FF/VI were modeled to experience 0.49 severe exacerbations compared to 0.53 for usual care. Over the 10‐year time horizon, this increased to 4.8 severe exacerbations for FF/VI and 5.2 for usual care. In the first year, time spent in well, partially, and uncontrolled states were 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 life‐years (LY) for FF/VI and 0.3, 0.2, and 0.5 LY for usual care. Over 10‐years, time spent in these health states amounted to 5.0, 2.0, and 2.1 LY for FF/VI and 3.9, 2.2, and 3.0 LY for usual care. Across the probabilistic analysis, FF/VI was dominant (cost‐savings and effectiveness benefit) at 52‐weeks, with 0.007 gain in QALYs and $414 total cost savings. When extrapolated to 10‐years, total discounted cost‐savings and QALY gains per patient were projected to be $3782 and 0.059 respectively. FF/VI remained dominant in >99% of iterations for both time horizons. CONCLUSIONS: Using real world evidence from SLS, this analysis demonstrates that FF/VI treatment confers both improved effectiveness and cost‐savings for managing asthma in Canadian adults, compared to current usual care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: FF/VI is an effective treatment and cost‐saving for adult asthma in Canada.

AB: BACKGROUND Lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd) is the most common induction regimen for patients with NDMM before ASCT. In 2017, lenalidomide (R), as maintenance therapy (R‐MT), became the first approved drug for patients (pts) who had undergone an upfront ASCT in the United States (US) and Europe. While other therapies (eg, thalidomide, bortezomib) have been studied in the maintenance setting they are not currently approved or proven to improve survival. There is limited real‐world evidence comparing treatment (Tx) outcomes in pts who receive RVd followed by ASCT and R‐MT vs those who receive RVd induction followed by ASCT and other maintenance therapies (O‐MT) or no maintenance therapy (No‐MT). This study aimed to assess real‐world outcomes associated with these different sequencing approaches. METHODS A retrospective observational study of pts with NDMM was conducted using electronic health records from a nationally representative database (Flatiron Health). The Flatiron MM provider network comprises over 265 clinics throughout the US. Pts with an ICD‐9 (203.0x) or ICD‐10 (C90.xx) diagnosis of MM between 01/01/2011 and 05/31/2017 were randomly selected into the study. Pts were excluded if they did not have ≥ 2 documented clinical visits during the study period. The diagnosis of MM was confirmed through review of unstructured chart data (eg, physician notes). The index date was defined as the earlier of date of ASCT + 90 days or start of MT. Pts with NDMM were defined as those without a MM Tx > 14 days prior to their first diagnosis date. The start of first‐line (1L) therapy was defined as the first episode of an eligible systemic Tx given after or up to 14 days before the MM diagnosis. Regimens were defined using the first eligible drug episode plus other eligible drugs given within 28 days of each other. A maximum gap of 180 days was allowed within a given line of therapy (LOT). Clinical characteristics at baseline were assessed at diagnosis as well as the index date. Treatments not considered consolidation or MT were considered as the next LOT. Time to next treatment (TTNT) was defined as the duration from the index date until the initiation of another LOT. The Kaplan‐Meier (KM) method was used to calculate median TTNT, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate risk factors for TTNT. RESULTS Of 632 patients receiving ASCT in the first LOT, 280 pts (44.3%) received RVd induction and met inclusion criteria. Among these, 145 received R‐MT, 112 received No‐MT, and 23 received O‐MT. Sample sizes limited statistical comparisons between the R‐MT and O‐MT groups. There were no significant differences in age (59.7 vs 59.6 years), sex, race, geographical region, or practice type between R‐MT and No‐MT pts. A smaller proportion of R‐MT pts progressed to a second line (2L) than No‐MT pts (22.1% vs 34.1%; P= .004). The proportion of pts receiving O‐MT who received a 2L was 47.8%. Second line regimens varied in frequency in each MT group and included Rd, RVd, Vd, and other triplet combinations. Pts with R‐MT had a significantly longer median TTNT (52.24 months [95% CI, 39.97‐NR]) than pts with No‐MT (21.32 months [95% CI, 3.82 months‐ NR]; P < .001); Figure 1). Factors associated with a higher probability of advancing to 2L included No‐MT (HR, 5.466 [95% CI, 3.34‐8.946]; P < .001) and presence of anemia at baseline (HR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.322‐2.059]; P < .0001). CONCLUSION For pts with NDMM who are eligible for ASCT, R‐MT was the most frequent maintenance therapy in pts receiving first‐line RVd. The regimen of RVd induction followed by R‐MT had superior outcomes compared with No‐MT. Pts on R‐MT were less likely to progress and had a significantly longer TTNT than No‐MT pts. In the real‐world setting, these results appear to be similar to those observed in clinical trials (McCarthy et al. N Engl J Med . 2012; McCarthy PL. J Clin Oncol . 2017). A great level of heterogeneity existed among second line regimens. Future studies should be conducted to better understand patient and disease characteristics that are predictors of receiving specific maintenance and second line therapies. (Figure Presented).

AB: Introduction: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a hematologic malignancy for which frontline treatment options and outcomes have remained unchanged for several decades. HL is considered to have a favorable prognosis although failure rates after FL therapy range from 10% to 30% depending on stage. Patients who fail go on to bear the burden of additional therapy after FL. Little real‐world evidence exists on the burden of disease for patients who fail FL (FLF) therapy for healthcare providers to contextualize the value of novel therapies. This study aimed to identify FLF patients and compare healthcare costs between HL patients with and without FLF. Methods: This retrospective analysis used the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental administrative claims databases to select adults aged >18 years with ≥ 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient claims with a HL diagnosis (ICD‐9 201.xx excluding Hodgkin paragranuloma, Hodgkin sarcoma and lymphocytic‐histiocytic predominance) from 1/1/2010 to 9/30/2015. Eligible patients were required to have continuous plan enrollment for > 6 months prior to the diagnosis, no prior cancer, and initiate a multi‐agent regimen indicative of curative intent. Patients were in the FLF cohort if they had one of the following failure events: initiate a new chemotherapy after discontinuing FL (gap >60 days with no chemotherapy), switch to a new treatment, or having a stem cell transplant (SCT). Patients were in FLF+XRT cohort if they also received radiation after completing FL chemotherapy. Index dates for the FLF and FLF+XRT cohorts were the earliest date of the failure events, and were randomly assigned for non‐FLF patients based on distribution of intervals between FL start date and index date for the FLF cohort. They had to have > 30‐day post‐index continuous enrollment and followed until date of disenrollment, death, or end of the study period. Annual healthcare costs were measured at 12‐month post‐index periods among patients with > 12‐months post‐index continuous enrollment. Costs were measured during FL and the entire follow‐up period (reported as per patient per month [PPPM]). Results: 795 patients met the selection criterion (mean age 38.5 years, 47.5% female). 67.8% of patients 18‐44 years old, 26.4% 45‐64 years old, and 5.8% ≥65 years old. Most resided in urban areas (81.9%), and the mean pre‐index Charlson Comorbidity Index score of study patients was 2.9±1.9. The two most frequent coded comorbidities during FL were symptoms involving the respiratory system (41.3%) and cardiovascular (22.9%) in both cohorts. Of the patients in the FL+XRT cohort, 60.1% received XRT after FL discontinuation, 21.8% discontinued and restarted therapy, 10.4% switched to a new therapy, and 7.8% went on to a SCT directly after FL. The PPPM costs for FLF cohort during the follow up was $12,494 (N=77, Table 1) and the annual all‐cause cost of failure was $160,839 (N=33, Table 2) higher than patients who did not fail FL. The PPPM costs in FLF+XRT cohort (N=193) was $11,918 (vs $7,772) (Table 1). The annual all‐cause cost in was $68,431 (N=94) higher than patients in non‐FLF cohort (Table 2). PPPM costs during FL in FLF+XRT was $21,676 (vs $16,396) (Table 1) driven by outpatient services (50.5%) and inpatient admissions (48.6%). The FLF+XRT (vs non‐FLF) cohort had a significantly shorter duration of FL therapy (average of 112 vs 131 days, p<0.05). The economic burden of failure varied by type (Table 3). The annual costs of failure due to restarting, switching, SCT, or radiation were $269,189, $46,951, $231,824, and $55,989, respectively. Similar trends in cost were observed among patients with ≥24 months post‐index enrollment (n=200). Conclusions: HL patients who fail FL represent a substantially higher economic burden compared to those without FLF, not accounting for stage at diagnosis. We did not assess the indirect costs or societal impact of FLF for the population and therefore this is an underestimate of the overall burden. More research is needed to determine optimal treatment that could reduce the risk of progression, the need for treatment after completion of FL and enhance long‐term clinical and economic outcomes.

AB: What Are We Learning from Pragmatic Clinical Trials?Design, Implementation and Analytic StrategiesSeveral different US research organizations have beenconducting pragmatic clinical trials (PCT) in a variety ofhealth care settings. Pragmatic clinical trials provide anopportunity for testing interventions in real‐world settings, as they embed trial interventions into routine clinical care delivered by health care systems. As a number oflarge‐scale pragmatic clinical trials have been launchedand completed within these organizations, much hasbeen learned regarding their unique design, implementation and analytic challenges. This session will describerecent efforts from these programs that have focused onperforming PCT across many health care delivery organizations, including those within academic, corporateand federal systems. Studies conducted thus far haveprovided important lessons learned for both planningand implementation of future pragmatic trials. The panelincludes scientists from the Patient‐Centered OutcomesResearch Institute, the US Department of VeteransAffairs Point of Care Research program, and the HealthCare Systems Research Collaboratory supported by theNational Institutes of Health; and will use ongoing PCTas case studies for specific challenges that must beaddressed for successful trial implementation.Perspectives from the Patient‐Centered OutcomesResearch Institute (PCORI)‐Jason GersonThis presentation will briefly characterize PCORI'sportfolio of PCT, which are intended to generaterobust and real‐world evidence about the comparativeeffectiveness of known efficacious interventions. Thesetrials are designed and conducted under conditionsmeant to reflect the decisional context faced by patientsand providers, and strive to mimic the actual use conditions under which the intervention(s) would be applied.The presentation will then describe several criticalissues concerning the design and implementation ofPCT, including the extent to which non‐adherence(both provider and patient) should be monitored andremedied, and the inclusion of patient‐reported outcome data not routinely collected as part of clinicalpractice. Strategies for how these issues were addressedin ongoing trials will further illustrate how investigatorscan enhance planning efforts for future work.Veterans Affairs Point of Care Research (POC‐R)Program‐Ryan FergusonThis presentation will highlight the progress to date andlessons learned from a large PCT embedded within theVA Healthcare System's electronic medical record. Thisclinical trial, the Diuretic Comparison Project, is aimedat testing the comparative effectiveness of two commonantihypertensive medications at preventing cardiovascular outcomes in Veterans over age 65 with hypertension.Topics addressed will focus on real‐world strategies forleveraging the use of the electronic medical record forpatient phenotyping, outcome ascertainment, safety surveillance, and communication with healthcare providers.Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory,National Institutes of Health‐Robin BoineauThe NIH Collaboratory has launched several PCTsembedded within a variety of health care systems acrossthe US. This presentation will focus on several aspects ofhealth care systems interactions for clinical investigatorsand their teams, which must be addressed in both theplanning and implementation phases of a PCT. In view ofthe ever‐changing landscape of health care delivery, allCollaboratory teams worked closely with their health caresystem partners to address challenges in planning for trialinitiation (intervention delivery and EHR) and after trialinitiation (staff changes, maintaining intervention delivery,reliable data collection via the EHR). Specific case studyexamples from the NIH Collaboratory will be presented,with lessons learned on strategies of future investigatorsas they partner with health care system leadership.Lessons from Pragmatic Clinical Trials for PainManagement‐Lynn DeBarThis presentation will highlight study design and methodological issues involved in embedding a complex behavioral intervention into the primary care setting(multidisciplinary treatment for patients with chronicpain on opioid treatment). Issues to be discussed includeimplications of cluster randomized approaches, intervention staffing, collection of patient reported outcomes,and the culture and infrastructure of primary care settings for integrating the PCT into the clinical work flow and potential sustainability. Effectiveness‐implementation hybrid designs will also be described, as a potentiallybeneficial framework for these types of PCT.Pragmatic Clinical Trial Methodologic &AnalyticStrategies‐Patrick HeagertyEmbedded PCT within health care systems provideopportunities for efficiently answering important researchquestions that can improve clinical care. Several PCT conducted with US programs thus far have presented designand analytic challenges that were addressed in the trialplanning phase. As these programs have launched severalPCT across many disciplines, centralized Design &Biostatistics Working Groups were created within the programs to facilitate trial planning, and to develop methodsand best practices for future research. This presentationwill describe specific methodologic challenges for the planning of cluster‐randomized PCT, including design, randomization strategy, assumptions for sample size andstatistical analysis. Case studies from both PCORI andthe NIH Collaboratory programs will describe approachesthat have been successful, and highlight a process thatmaximizes scientific rigor across PCT programs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Targeted B‐cell receptor signaling pathway inhibitors have changed the treatment landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, treatment decisions remain challenging due to emergence of therapeutic resistance and uncertainties regarding optimal sequencing of therapies. Clinical trials have focused on single treatment options and reported limited outcome data. With increasing options for CLL treatment, research on how to best sequence CLL treatments is needed to optimize patient outcomes. METHODS: The CLL Collaborative Study of Real‐World Evidence (CORE) study is a retrospective, multicenter, international, collaborative observational study of patients (pts) with CLL treated at either community or academic sites. For this analysis, pts were randomly selected and eligible for inclusion if they started 1st‐line CLL therapy from January 1st , 2012 through present. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and progression‐free survival (PFS) were evaluated. The reason(s) for discontinuing 1st‐line and initiating 2nd‐line therapy were collected; multiple reasons could be selected. For this analysis, pts were grouped according to whether they received novel agent‐based therapy (eg, ibrutinib, idelalisib, venetoclax) or chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy (CT/CIT) as 1st‐line treatment. RESULTS: Of 351 pts studied, 179 received CT/CIT and 172 received novel agents as 1st‐line therapy. Patient data, stratified by 1st‐line therapy (CT/CIT vs. novel agents), are shown in Table 1. Most pts were treated in community settings (81%). The median ages were 62 and 66 years for pts receiving CT/CIT and novel agents, respectively. Demographics were generally similar between CT/CIT and novel agent groups with one exception: 17p deletion/TP53 mutations were present in 20% who received novel agents, compared to only 4% who received CT/CIT (p <0.0001). The most common 1st‐line CT/CIT treatments were bendamustine + rituximab (56%; 101/179), fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab (20%), chlorambucil + obinutuzumab (8%), and fludarabine + rituximab (5%). The most common novel‐agent based therapies were ibrutinib (80%; 138/172), ibrutinib + rituximab (7%), and venetoclax‐based treatments (7%). Median follow up was longer for pts who received CT/CIT compared to novel agents in the 1st‐line (15.6 vs. 9.9 months). For pts with intact 17p and nonmutated TP53 (n=286), the 12‐month PFS was 90% and 87% for pts who received CT/CIT and novel agents as 1st‐line, respectively (unadjusted hazard ratio: 1.11 [95% CI 0.6‐2.0]; p = 0.73). Among pts treated with 1st‐line CT/CIT, 27% (n=49) received 2nd‐line therapy after a median of 14.2 months; the majority initiated 2nd‐line due to relapse/progression (84%; 41/49). Of pts treated with novel agents in the 1st‐line, 31% (n=53) discontinued and 18% (n=31) initiated 2nd‐line therapy; common reasons for discontinuing novel agents were disease progression/refractory to treatment (34%; 18/53), completed scheduled duration of treatment (30%; 16/53), and adverse events/intolerance (19%; 10/53). The most common reason for initiating 2nd‐line therapy after 1stline novel agent was relapse (48%; 15/31); median time to next treatment was 8.0 months. Regardless of 1st‐line therapy, >80% of pts received a novel agent‐based therapy as 2nd‐line treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, pts with CLL treated since 2012 with CT/CIT or novel agent‐based therapies (87% ibrutinib‐based) in 1st‐line had similar demographics; notably, more pts with 17p deletion/TP53 mutation were treated with novel agents. Although treatment failure was the primary reason for initiating 2nd‐line therapy, many pts discontinued novel agents for other reasons, including adverse events and, unexpectedly, completion of therapy. With limited follow‐up, in patients largely from community setting, PFS was similar between pts treated with CT/CIT and novel agents; more analyses are necessary to determine whether outcomes are impacted due to discontinuation of treat‐to‐progression novel agents for reasons other than progression. Overall, novel agents were the 2nd‐line therapy of choice, irrespective of 1st‐line therapy. These data constitute a first‐look at CORE, a long‐term study designed to determine how novel therapies and treatment sequencing impacts adverse events and outcomes in the treatment of CLL..
