Qualitative Research in Epidemiology 
Susana Silva and Sílvia Fraga, University of Porto Medical School, Institute of Public Health of the University of Porto Portugal


Qualitative studies employ non-numeric methods to obtain "richer" information on how people perceive or experience situations. Qualitative data provide answers to specific research questions in epidemiological studies, by focusing on the understanding of meanings, beliefs, and attitudes from the point of view of the social actors (Lloyd, 2000; Mays & Pope, 1995), allowing in depth analysis of human behaviour. 

Popay (2003) synthetized the contributions of qualitative research to epidemiology in two contrasting models: 

The enhancement model, which perceives qualitative research as adding a little extra to the knowledge provided by traditional epidemiological research through explaining unexpected results, generating hypotheses to be tested by quantitative epidemiological research, and helping to develop measures of social phenomena. 
The epistemological model, which presupposes an equal relationship between qualitative and quantitative approaches, recognizing the possibility of challenge and tension between them, expressed on the following specific contributions of qualitative methods to epidemiological research: addressing different kinds of questions; shifting the balance between the researcher and the researched; and adding conceptual and theoretical depth to knowledge.


Qualitative methods are useful for studies with the following broad objectives (Alderson, 2001: 5-6): 

To explore and map out a little known field and to give voice to habitually silenced and excluded groups. 
To provide detailed findings on people’s views and experiences and to understand how they make sense of their beliefs, values, rules and behaviours with a flexibility which standardized quantitative enquiries cannot cater for. 
To discuss new questions and emerging theories or conclusions through data collection, working reflexively. 
To reveal and analyse complexity, difference, ambiguity, contradiction and gradual changes which are hard to capture in more static quantitative measures. 
Qualitative interviews have been categorised as structured, unstructured, semi-structured, and in-depth.

Documental analysis refers to the use of a wide range of existing written and/or visual sources related to a topic. While existing documents are one of the most accessible and widely available sources that can be used in epidemiological studies, health researchers cannot take them for granted as reliable sources of information. 

In qualitative health research observational methods provide direct access to what people do, as well as to what they say and think. 

Qualitative data analysis ideally occurs concurrently with data collection. During this iterative process, the investigators generate an emerging understanding about research questions with two main objectives: first, this preliminary analysis leads to the identification of issues where data need to be further enriched; second, it informs the sampling process, in the sense that researchers are aware of the point in the data collection in which no new categories/themes emerge – data saturation -, signaling that data collection is complete. 

Excellence in qualitative research analysis depends on the experience and expertise of researchers. 

Three main broader analytic strategies have been widely used to analyze and interpret qualitative data:   
* an “editing approach”, when researchers review, identify and interpret text segments like an editor;  
* a “template approach”, when investigators apply categories based on a code-book that results from prior research and theoretical perspectives; and  
* an “immersion/crystallization approach”, a less structured approach which involves several reflective cycles until interpretations intuitively crystallize (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). 

Content analysis is the most commonly used technique for qualitative data analysis. It involves the categorization and indexation of recurrent data or common major themes.

Systematic sorting of transcripts, line by line, to sift, chart, and sort material.
Intensive scrutiny of notes and transcripts. 
Regular checking and re-checking of all the data, to evaluate the relevance of selected categories and their connection with data. 
Comparison of each segment in turn to appraise its relevance to categories and to map the range and variation of each category. 
Counting all references to certain issues or use of certain words. 

In epidemiology generalizability or external validity refers to the extent to which findings from a study apply to a wider population or to different contexts. Qualitative studies rarely use random sampling, and the logic of generalizability is quite different from that of a sample survey. The qualitative findings are not supposed to be valid for population groups at large as they are descriptions, notions, or theories applicable within a specific setting but always within a wider context. 

In qualitative research the generalizability of the findings is defined in relation to relevant literature, which enables researchers to show how far the research data and conclusions can be applied in other settings or to other groups. Thus, analytic generalization is associated with the generalization of a theory that explain the phenomenon being studied, or a theory that may have much wider applicability than the particular case studied. 



In this context, the concept of generalizability gives rise to the concept of transferability. Transferability refers to the degree to which the findings of qualitative research can be generalized or transferred to other contexts or settings, a responsibility of the researcher who is doing the generalization. The qualitative researcher can enhance transferability by doing a thorough job of describing the research context and its central assumptions. The person who wishes to "transfer" the findings to a different context is then responsible for making the judgment of how sensible the transfer is.



Popay (2003: 62) identified the following common “technical” quality assessment criteria: 

Appropriateness of the method to research question. 
Explicit link to theory. 
Clearly stated aims and objectives. 
Clear description of context, of sample and of fieldwork methods. 
Some validation of data analysis. 
Inclusion of sufficient data to support interpretation. 
Qualitative researchers commonly relate the well known principles of truth, respect, justice and avoiding harm with overlapping criteria for assessing research – validity, reliability and replicability, representativeness, and generalizability – taking into account bias as part of the methods and the findings. The following strategies have been used to guard against potentially adverse effects (Alderson, 2001: 10): 

Asking a balanced range of questions. 
Checking through all the data for how typical or exceptional each kind of response is.
Examining the important unusual cases as to how and why they might be unusual, and the relevant examples that seem to challenge or disapprove a tentative general theory. 
Being aware of researchers’ own prejudices and how they might affect the way the data are collected and interpreted. 
Selecting a broad sample of different types. 
The following set of good practice guidelines will add credibility to the analysis and assure the validity of qualitative findings (Green & Thorogood, 2009; Popay et al., 1998): 



Transparency - The methods should be clearly stated and described in-depth to the audience, allowing other researchers to follow the same steps. An honest account of how the sample was chosen, how analysis was performed, and how the coding categories were developed should be provided. 

Maximising validity - Validity means the truth of an interpretation, not in the sense of a positivist idea of a fixed truth, but a truth that is socially situated. Interpretations should be grounded both on theoretical approaches and empirical data, with relevant quotes to illustrate the typicality. The following strategies can contribute to maximize validity in qualitative studies: first, a simple count of answers can increase the audience’s faith in validity, but it is not always appropriate; second, providing in-depth descriptions of the context with the purpose of facilitating the understanding of the interpretation, including, for example, the characteristics of the interviewers, the research setting and technical procedures. 

Maximising reliability - Reliability relates to the repeatability of interpretation, that is, when the same methodological procedures are followed within a context with similar characteristics, the finding should be analogous. A strategy for improving reliability can include having more than one researcher coding and analyzing the data. At the same time, the line of thought behind codes and themes should be clearly recognized. However, qualitative research about personal experiences of health and illness are still harder to replicate, because people’s knowledge and feelings may be complex, ambiguous and may depend on time, place and whom they are talking to. Thus, reliability also depends on giving a faithful report of peoples’ changing accounts (Alderson, 2001: 9). 

Comparative - Qualitative researchers should compare all the narratives in order to find regularities in the data, and they should compare their findings with other findings attained in the same context or field or those that relate theoretically to the issue. 



Reflexivity - Taking into account that a qualitative researcher is part of the process of producing data and their meanings, reflexivity must guide his/her conducts. A reflexive awareness of the research process, the researcher’s role, even the social setting or social context, would increase the rigor of analysis. Qualitative researchers should examine not only what people say and do, but also “why they might be saying these words and how the interview setting, the questions and themes, and the relationship between interviewee and interviewer might influence how each person reacts, as together they construct and re-construct their conversations” (Alderson, 2001: 14). 

Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software, such as NVivo Research Software®, NUD*IST, ATLAS.ti or Ethnograph, are available to assist in data management and they can draft content analysis through coding and systematic retrieval of data.

Broadly speaking, qualitative research tends to answer the “why?” and “how?” questions surrounding public health topics, in contrast to quantitative methodologies which tend to focus on epidemiological estimates of prevalence and strength of associations between variables. 



Qualitative methods are often employed when generating hypotheses which may be later developed into interventions and tested in randomised controlled trials. Moreover, qualitative research can provide additional understanding about a research topic that may be inaccessible using quantitative methods: for example, understanding why patients fail to adhere to prescribed treatments; why people undertake certain healthy (and unhealthy) behaviours; what concerns people have about their health and ill health; and how people conceptualise their illnesses. Qualitative research can provide insights that specialists and researchers may not have considered beforehand. In this way, qualitative methods can enhance quantitative research methods such as questionnaires and improve service design and delivery.



Qualitative research deliberately uses non-probability samples for selecting the study population. In this approach participants are selected purposely because of specific characteristics, which are of relevance to the research question; this is called purposive sampling. As explained by Patton, “the power of [purposive] sampling lies in selecting information-rich cases to study in depth. Information-rich cases are those from which one can learn a great deal about issues of central importance…”(1).



Theoretical saturation is the term used to describe the point at which no new contribution to the emerging findings is obtained from further analysis of interviews/focus groups/observations. Qualitative researchers should aim to reach theoretical saturation before concluding data collection to ensure that the pertinent concepts have been retrieved.



Qualitative research is often circular, iterative, and interpretive and therefore exact reproducibility of findings by other researchers is neither expected nor desired.  Rather than expect independent researchers to reach identical conclusions from qualitative data, reliability in qualitative research is measured by how well the methods of analysis are documented and understood. The following techniques are often used as a benchmark for assessing the quality of qualitative research.



Triangulation

Triangulation was traditionally considered a means of validating a research conclusion through use of two or more other techniques. However, triangulation may also be used to enhance interpretation by providing additional insights into the experience, for example by combining findings from observations with participant interviews to reach a more complete understanding of the issue or topic under investigation.



Clear documentation of the research process

Clear documentation of the methods involved in data collection and analysis, as detailed above, increases the trustworthiness of the research.



Supporting theory with quotes from the transcripts

Evidence to support interpretations, using primary data in the form of participant quotes, helps ensure that readers can trust that the investigator’s interpretations remain grounded in the data. Consent to use anonymous quotes should be obtained from all participants beforehand.



Limitation

This describes the process of testing how well the findings of the research (often known as the “theory” that has been generated from the primary data) fit the data, establishing the “limits” of the theory. It is accepted that the research findings will be relevant to certain contexts only, and by identifying and discussing “deviant” or “negative” cases – i.e. those that do not conform to the theory – it is possible to delimit the theory.



Falsification

This is the approach in which theory generated from the primary analysis is then “falsified” against each participant case within the dataset, one by one (4). This process is also described as a core component of “Analytic Induction” (5). If the individual case does not “fit” with the theory then the theory is modified or adapted to incorporate the case.



Member checking

This is when the analytical themes and interpretive findings are formally tested within the sample of participants from where the data arose in an attempt to enhance validity. Whilst member checking can provide an opportunity to “test” early findings with participants, it also assumes a “true” reality that is fixed over time and can and should be corroborated by individual participants. This stance conflicts with the interpretivist position that there is no objective “truth”; rather the learning and theoretical insight generated from the qualitative interviews should arise from the investigator’s immersion in the entire data. It can be argued therefore that comparing the investigator’s interpretation with the participants’ understanding of their data is discordant with the interpretivist approach. Nevertheless, member checking is sometimes used as a means of enhancing the quality and reliability of qualitative research.



Reflexivity

All high quality qualitative research should involve a discussion of the researcher’s reflexivity. This is a subjective examination of the extent to which the investigator’s own relationship with the topic, the participants, or settings may influence the research findings. Furthermore, any theory used by the researcher to approach the study should be explicitly considered and documented, as this will influence the analytical process and the ultimate findings of the research.
