## Survival analysis
Time to first hospitalization by gender for any disease  
Time to first Metabolic disease by gender  
Time to first RMSD disease by gender  

Same could be done for gender and season

Average time between 2 visits by gender -- t-test
Same analysis by each disease if it makes sense?

TraMineR:

Sequence index plot
Mean time spent in each state
Transition rate
State distribution plot
Shannon Entropy index: transversal entropies [0 (in the same state all through), 1 (Many changes in one's state)], pick up the modal state to modal state sequence

Longitudinal parameters:
Distinct Successive States and duration of each state (duration may not be possible for our data)
Longitudinal entropy [total of time spent at each state]
